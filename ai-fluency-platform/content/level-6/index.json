An AI Platformizer standardizes the \"AI Stack,\" ensuring that teams across the organization can build securely and efficiently while managing costs and risks.\n\nOrganizations that fail to build this platform layer face significant challenges: approximately 46% of AI initiatives stall as proofs-of-concept that never reach production scale. The Platformizer bridges the gap between technical teams and executive leadership, transforming one-off AI projects into repeatable, governed, and cost-effective capabilities.\n\n### What You Will Learn\n\n| Module | Topic | Key Skills |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 6.1 | MLOps Fundamentals | ML lifecycle, experiment tracking, model registry |\n| 6.2 | Inference Serving | Optimization, quantization, batching, caching |\n| 6.3 | Monitoring and Drift | Model monitoring, data drift, concept drift detection |\n| 6.4 | Governance and Compliance | AI governance frameworks, risk management, regulatory compliance |\n| 6.5 | Cost Management | Token economics, compute optimization, cost modeling |\n| 6.6 | Checkpoint | Level 6 assessment |\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting Level 6, you should be comfortable with:\n\n- Building multi-agent agentic workflows (Level 5)\n- Transformer architecture and fine-tuning techniques\n- Evaluation frameworks and metrics for AI systems\n- System-level thinking about AI components and their interactions\n\n### The Platformizer Mindset\n\nThe shift from System Engineer to Platformizer is a shift from **building systems** to **enabling others to build systems**. You are no longer the sole architect; you are creating the foundations, guardrails, and observability that allow dozens of teams to ship AI-powered features safely."
