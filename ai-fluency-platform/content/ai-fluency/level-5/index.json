      "content": "# Level 5: AI System Engineer\n\nLevel 5 represents the stage of mastery where a professional understands the deep architecture that powers modern AI *and* can design multi-component systems that put that understanding to work. An AI System Engineer knows not just *how* to use models, but *why* they behave the way they do -- and can leverage that understanding to build, evaluate, fine-tune, and orchestrate sophisticated AI systems.\n\n## What You Will Learn\n\nThis level covers three complementary parts:\n\n### Part 1: AI Internals (5.1-5.4)\n\n1. **Transformer Architecture** -- The encoder-decoder structure, positional encoding, and the architecture behind \"Attention Is All You Need.\"\n\n2. **Attention Mechanism** -- Query, Key, and Value vectors, multi-head attention, and how models decide what to focus on.\n\n3. **Fine-Tuning** -- LoRA, QLoRA, RLHF, and domain adaptation techniques for customizing models to specialized tasks.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics** -- BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, human evaluation, and building rigorous benchmark suites.\n\n### Part 2: Agentic Systems (5.5-5.9)\n\n5. **Agentic Workflows** -- ReAct prompting, tool use, multi-agent systems, and orchestration patterns for autonomous AI behavior.\n\n6. **Tool Protocols and MCP** -- How agents discover and use tools through standardized protocols, from function calling to the Model Context Protocol.\n\n7. **Subagents and Delegation** -- Spawning specialized agents for parallel work with isolated context, typed capabilities, and structured delegation.\n\n8. **Multi-Agent Teams** -- Coordinating multiple agents on shared objectives with task lists, message passing, and graceful lifecycle management.\n\n9. **Building Custom Agents** -- Building agents programmatically with SDKs, from tool definitions to deployment and testing strategies.\n\n### Part 3: System Architecture (5.10-5.14)\n\n10. **Orchestration Frameworks** -- Comparing LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, and n8n for building multi-step AI workflows, plus when to use frameworks versus custom code.\n\n11. **Human-in-the-Loop Design** -- Designing effective human oversight with confidence-based routing, escalation thresholds, and strategies to prevent approval fatigue.\n\n12. **Multi-AI System Architecture** -- Separation of concerns with router, specialist, and evaluator models, plus SLIs and SLOs for probabilistic systems.\n\n13. **System-Level Cost and Performance** -- Token budgets, batch versus real-time inference, cost accounting across multi-model pipelines, and optimization strategies.\n\n14. **Checkpoint** -- Level 5 assessment covering all three parts.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou should have completed all Level 4 content and be comfortable with:\n\n- Treating AI as a software component with typed interfaces (Level 4)\n- Engineering patterns for reliability and cost (Level 4)\n- API integration and deterministic wrappers (Level 4)\n- A basic understanding of linear algebra (Foundations)\n\n## The Three-Part Journey"

      "content": "At Level 4, you learned to engineer *around* AI's probabilistic nature. Level 5 is a three-part journey:\n\n**Part 1: AI Internals (Modules 5.1-5.4)** takes you *inside* the model. Understanding transformers and attention mechanisms is not just academic -- it directly informs prompt design, model selection, fine-tuning decisions, and debugging. You will learn why models behave the way they do.\n\n**Part 2: Agentic Systems (Modules 5.5-5.9)** puts that understanding to work. Starting with the fundamentals of agentic workflows, you will progress through tool protocols (MCP), subagent delegation, multi-agent teams, and building custom agents with SDKs. This is where theory becomes practice -- you will configure real tools, design delegation strategies, and architect agent systems.\n\n**Part 3: System Architecture (Modules 5.10-5.14)** takes you *above* individual agents. Once you understand both model internals and agentic patterns, you are ready to design systems where multiple models and agents collaborate -- choosing the right orchestration frameworks, designing effective human oversight, architecting multi-model pipelines, and managing cost and performance at the system level.\n\nTogether, these three parts make you an engineer who can work at every level of the AI stack -- from attention weights to agent teams to system architecture."

How might understanding transformer internals help you design better interfaces -- for instance, setting appropriate token limits, choosing temperature values, or predicting when a model will struggle? And how does that extend to designing boundaries between multiple models in a system?"
