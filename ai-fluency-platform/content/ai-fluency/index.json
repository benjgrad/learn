It goes far beyond basic awareness of AI tools — it means developing the technical depth and strategic conviction to think, lead, and operate differently because AI exists.\n\nThis curriculum follows a seven-level framework, progressing from casual consumption of AI tools to pioneering fundamental research. At every level, you will build four core competencies: **Delegation**, **Description**, **Discernment**, and **Diligence**.\n\n## The Seven Levels\n\n## How This Platform Works\n\nEvery module on this platform uses an **evidence-based learning cycle**:\n\n1. **Predict** — Activate prior knowledge before encountering new material\n2. **Learn** — Engage with substantive technical content\n3. **Practice** — Apply concepts through hands-on exercises\n4. **Reflect** — Consolidate understanding through self-explanation\n5. **Connect** — Link new knowledge to other concepts and real-world applications\n\nThis structure is grounded in learning science research on retrieval practice, elaborative interrogation, and spaced repetition."
