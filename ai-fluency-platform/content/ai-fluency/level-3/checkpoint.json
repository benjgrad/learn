      "title": "Design a complete RAG system for a legal firm that needs to answer questions about thousands of case files. Specify: (1) What embedding model would you use and why? (2) Which vector database and why? (3) Your chunking strategy for legal documents. (4) Your grounding approach for high-stakes legal answers. (5) What metadata would you store?",
      "solution": "A strong design:\n\n1. **Embedding model**: A high-quality model like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or a legal-domain embedding model if available. Legal language has specialized vocabulary, so embedding quality matters significantly.\n\n2. **Vector database**: Pinecone or Qdrant for production. Legal firms need reliable, scalable infrastructure. pgvector if they already run PostgreSQL. ChromaDB only for prototyping.\n\n3. **Chunking strategy**: Recursive chunking based on document structure (sections, paragraphs). Legal documents have strong structural hierarchy (case name, facts, analysis, holding). Preserve paragraph integrity. Use 300-500 token chunks with 50-token overlap. Never split numbered clauses or citations.\n\n4. **Grounding approach**: Maximum rigor -- extractive-before-abstractive with mandatory citations. Every claim must reference a specific case file, section, and paragraph. Include confidence signaling (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). Add explicit instruction to say \"I cannot determine this from the available case files\" rather than speculate.\n\n5. **Metadata**: Case number, date filed, jurisdiction, case type (civil/criminal), parties involved, judge, outcome, document section. Enable filtering by jurisdiction and date range."

      "solution": "Possible causes and fixes:\n\n1. **Chunk boundary problem**: The relevant sentence was split across two chunks, and only the second half was retrieved, losing a negation or qualifier. **Fix**: Increase chunk overlap, or use semantic chunking that respects sentence boundaries.\n\n2. **Embedding ambiguity**: The chunk was retrieved because it was topically relevant, but it discusses an exception to the rule while the main rule is in a different chunk. **Fix**: Retrieve more chunks (increase top-k) so the model sees both the rule and the exception. Add re-ranking to prioritize the most directly relevant chunk.\n\n3. **Model hallucination despite context**: The model read the correct chunk but generated text that contradicts it -- especially likely with negations (\"employees are NOT eligible\" becomes \"employees are eligible\"). **Fix**: Add extractive-before-abstractive grounding. Force the model to quote exact text before synthesizing. Add adversarial verification (\"Review your answer against the quoted text. Does any claim contradict the source?\").\n\n4. **Stale or conflicting documents**: Two versions of a policy are indexed, and the model drew from the outdated version. **Fix**: Store document version and date as metadata. Filter retrieval to only return the most recent version. Implement a document lifecycle process that removes outdated documents from the index."

      "title": "Compare RAG and fine-tuning for this scenario: a healthcare company wants an AI assistant that answers patient questions about medications, side effects, and dosage guidelines. Which approach would you recommend and why? What are the risks of each?",
      "solution": "**Recommendation: RAG**, with extremely rigorous grounding.\n\n**Why RAG over fine-tuning:**\n- Drug information changes frequently (new warnings, recalls, updated dosage guidelines). RAG can re-index immediately; fine-tuning requires expensive retraining.\n- Accuracy is paramount in healthcare. RAG allows you to cite the exact source document (FDA label, manufacturer guidelines), making every claim verifiable.\n- Fine-tuning could bake outdated information into model weights, creating a liability if guidelines change between training runs.\n\n**Risks of RAG in healthcare:**\n- Hallucination despite grounding -- a wrong medication dosage could cause harm\n- Chunking errors that separate a drug name from its contraindications\n- Patients treating AI responses as medical advice without consulting a physician\n\n**Mitigation:** Mandatory disclaimers, strict confidence signaling, human review for all medication-specific answers, and explicit system instructions to direct patients to healthcare providers for personalized advice."

You also understand how model architecture affects your design choices, how to calculate the true cost of AI approaches, and how to compress context to balance quality against budget. If you can diagnose failures in a RAG pipeline and propose targeted fixes, you are ready for Level 4 -- where you start treating AI as a component in larger software systems."
