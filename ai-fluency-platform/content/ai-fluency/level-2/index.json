You used three basic patterns -- summarize, draft, brainstorm -- and saw that specificity improves results.\n\nLevel 2 transforms you from a casual user into a **prompt engineer**: someone who crafts inputs that minimize ambiguity and maximize the accuracy and usefulness of model output. Prompt engineering is not about tricks or hacks. It is about understanding how the model processes your instructions and structuring them accordingly.\n\n### What you will learn\n\n| Module | Topic | Core Idea |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 2.1 | Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Prompting | Teaching the model by example |\n| 2.2 | Chain-of-Thought Reasoning | Forcing step-by-step problem solving |\n| 2.3 | Roles and Personas | Shaping output through identity assignment |\n| 2.4 | Parameters and Control | Temperature, top-p, max tokens, delimiters |\n| 2.5 | Recursive Self-Improvement | Having the model critique and refine its own output |\n| 2.6 | Checkpoint | Test your prompt engineering skills |\n\n### The shift in competency focus\n\nAt Level 1, the emphasis was on **Discernment** -- recognizing that AI output is probabilistic. At Level 2, the emphasis shifts to **Description**: the ability to communicate goals and constraints so precisely that the model has minimal room for misinterpretation.\n\nThe difference between a Level 1 and Level 2 user is not that the Level 2 user knows more about AI. It is that the Level 2 user writes prompts that reliably produce the output they need on the first or second attempt, rather than the fifth or sixth."
