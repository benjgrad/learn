You typed something in, got something back, and thought: \"How does it know that?\" This level answers that question.\n\nThe goal of Level 1 is to shift your mental model from **AI as a magic box** to **AI as an inference engine** -- a system that uses statistical patterns learned during training to predict what text should come next.\n\n### What you will learn\n\n| Module | Topic | Core Idea |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 1.1 | AI as an Inference Engine | Training vs. inference -- the model is not \"thinking\" |\n| 1.2 | The Probabilistic Nature of AI | Why the same prompt gives different answers |\n| 1.3 | Basic Prompting Patterns | Summarize, draft, brainstorm -- your first toolkit |\n| 1.4 | Choosing the Right Model | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, open-source -- when to use what |\n| 1.5 | AI Is Not Thinking | Why fluent text is not understanding |\n| 1.6 | When Not to Trust AI | Domain-specific risks and verification |\n| 1.7 | Checkpoint | Test your recall without AI |\n\n### The 4D competencies at Level 1\n\nAt every level of this curriculum, four competencies shape how you work with AI:\n\n- **Delegation** -- Knowing which tasks to hand to AI and which to keep for yourself.\n- **Description** -- Communicating your goal clearly enough that the model can help.\n- **Discernment** -- Evaluating whether the output is accurate, useful, or nonsense.\n- **Diligence** -- Using AI responsibly, with awareness of its limitations.\n\nAt Level 1, the emphasis is on **Discernment**: learning to see AI output as a probabilistic prediction rather than an authoritative answer."
