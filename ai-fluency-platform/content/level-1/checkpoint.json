The goal is to recall and explain these ideas **without scrolling back** to the modules. If you find yourself struggling with a concept, that is valuable information -- revisit that module before moving to Level 2.\n\n### Concept recall"

      "solution": "The model is not broken. AI responses are probabilistic -- each time you send a prompt, the model samples from a probability distribution over possible next tokens. Different samples produce different outputs. The temperature setting controls how much variation occurs. If your colleague needs consistent responses, they should look for a way to lower the temperature or use an API with deterministic settings. The model is working exactly as designed."

      "solution": "**Task 1 (email classification):** Use a lightweight model (GPT-4o mini, Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash). Classification is a simple task with a constrained output space -- the model only needs to pick between two labels. A lightweight model handles this accurately, quickly, and cheaply at scale.\n\n**Task 2 (competitive analysis):** Use a flagship model (GPT-4, Claude Opus, Gemini Ultra). This task requires synthesizing complex information, reasoning about market dynamics, and producing nuanced prose. The additional capability of a flagship model justifies the higher cost for a one-off analytical task."
