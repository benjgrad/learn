      "content": "## What is RAG?\n\n**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an architecture that gives a language model access to external knowledge by retrieving relevant information and injecting it into the prompt before generation.\n\nWithout RAG, the model can only answer from its training data. With RAG, it can answer questions about documents, databases, and knowledge bases it has never seen -- as long as you provide the relevant context at query time.\n\n### The RAG pipeline in five steps\n\n```\nUser Query → Embed Query → Search Vector DB → Retrieve Chunks → Augment Prompt → Generate Response\n```\n\n**Step 1: User asks a question**\n```\n\"What is our company's policy on remote work for\ninternational employees?\"\n```\n\n**Step 2: Embed the query**\nConvert the question into a vector using the same embedding model used to embed the documents.\n\n**Step 3: Search the vector database**\nFind the document chunks whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding. Retrieve the top k results (typically 3-10).\n\n**Step 4: Augment the prompt**\nInject the retrieved text chunks into the prompt as context:\n```\nAnswer the following question based only on the provided\ncontext. If the context does not contain the answer,\nsay \"I don't have information about that.\"\n\nContext:\n---\n[Retrieved chunk 1: Remote work policy section 4.2...]\n[Retrieved chunk 2: International employee guidelines...]\n[Retrieved chunk 3: IT security for remote access...]\n---\n\nQuestion: What is our company's policy on remote work\nfor international employees?\n```\n\n**Step 5: Generate the response**\nThe model reads the context and generates an answer grounded in the retrieved documents rather than its general training data.\n\n### Why RAG works\n\nRAG is effective because it leverages the strengths of two different systems:\n\n| Component | Strength |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| **Vector database** | Fast, accurate retrieval from millions of documents |\n| **Language model** | Natural language understanding, synthesis, and generation |\n\nThe retrieval system finds relevant information. The language model synthesizes it into a coherent, natural-language answer. Neither component could do the other's job well on its own."

      "question": "If you instruct the model to 'only answer from the provided context,' will it always comply? Can the model still hallucinate in a RAG system?",
      "answer": "The model may still hallucinate. The instruction to \"only answer from the provided context\" biases the model toward the context, but it does not guarantee compliance. The model may:\n- Interpolate between context chunks in ways that introduce inaccuracies\n- Fill gaps in the context with information from its training data\n- Misinterpret a chunk and generate a plausible but incorrect synthesis\n\nRAG significantly reduces hallucination compared to raw generation, but it does not eliminate it. Grounding techniques (Module 3.5) further reduce this risk."

      "content": "### The two phases of RAG\n\nA RAG system has distinct **offline** and **online** phases:\n\n**Offline (indexing)** -- done once, or periodically:\n1. Collect documents (PDFs, web pages, databases)\n2. Chunk documents into smaller pieces (Module 3.4)\n3. Embed each chunk using an embedding model\n4. Store embeddings + metadata in the vector database\n\n**Online (query)** -- done for every user question:\n1. Embed the user's query\n2. Search the vector database for similar chunks\n3. Construct the augmented prompt\n4. Send to the language model\n5. Return the response\n\nThe offline phase is a one-time investment. The online phase adds latency (embedding + search + generation), but embedding and search typically take only milliseconds, so the user experience is dominated by the model's generation time.\n\n### RAG vs. fine-tuning\n\nA common question: should you use RAG or fine-tune the model on your data?\n\n| Factor | RAG | Fine-tuning |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| **Data freshness** | Can update instantly (re-index documents) | Requires retraining to update |\n| **Cost** | Lower (no training required) | Higher (GPU compute for training) |\n| **Accuracy for specific facts** | High (retrieves exact text) | Lower (facts embedded in weights) |\n| **Domain style/tone** | Inherits model's default style | Can learn domain-specific style |\n| **Implementation complexity** | Moderate (pipeline setup) | Higher (training infrastructure) |\n\nFor most enterprise use cases, RAG is the right starting point. Fine-tuning is better when you need the model to adopt a specific writing style or domain-specific reasoning pattern."

      "solution": "For example, a **developer documentation chatbot**:\n\n1. **Documents**: API reference pages, tutorials, migration guides, release notes, FAQ\n2. **Queries**: \"How do I authenticate with the v3 API?\" or \"What changed in the latest release?\"\n3. **Augmented prompt**: \"You are a helpful documentation assistant. Answer the developer's question using only the following documentation excerpts. If the answer is not in the excerpts, say so. [retrieved chunks] Question: [user query]\"\n4. **What could go wrong**: Outdated documentation retrieved over current docs; chunks split across a multi-step procedure losing context; embedding model does not capture code semantics well; user asks about something not in the docs and the model fabricates an answer.\n\nIdentifying failure modes upfront is what separates context engineers from casual RAG users."
