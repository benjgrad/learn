      "content": "## From words to numbers\n\nIn Level 1, you learned that models process tokens -- numeric representations of text fragments. **Embeddings** take this further: they represent entire words, sentences, or documents as **vectors** (lists of numbers) in a high-dimensional space.\n\nAn embedding might look like this (simplified to 5 dimensions):\n\n```\n\"cat\"  → [0.82, -0.14, 0.53, 0.21, -0.67]\n\"dog\"  → [0.79, -0.11, 0.48, 0.25, -0.72]\n\"car\"  → [-0.31, 0.67, -0.22, 0.81, 0.15]\n```\n\nIn reality, embeddings have hundreds or thousands of dimensions (768, 1024, or 1536 are common). Each dimension captures some aspect of meaning, though individual dimensions do not map neatly to human-understandable concepts.\n\n### Semantic similarity\n\nThe key insight: **words with similar meanings are close together in vector space**. \"Cat\" and \"dog\" are close because they share semantic properties (animals, pets, four-legged). \"Car\" is far away because it represents a completely different concept.\n\nThis closeness is measured mathematically using **cosine similarity** -- the angle between two vectors. A cosine similarity of 1.0 means identical meaning, 0.0 means unrelated, and -1.0 means opposite.\n\n| Pair | Cosine similarity | Interpretation |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| \"happy\" vs. \"joyful\" | ~0.92 | Near-synonyms |\n| \"happy\" vs. \"sad\" | ~0.35 | Related (emotions) but different |\n| \"happy\" vs. \"database\" | ~0.05 | Unrelated |\n\n### The famous example: vector arithmetic\n\nEmbeddings capture **relational** meaning, not just similarity. The classic example:\n\n```\nking - man + woman ≈ queen\n```\n\nThis works because the vector difference between \"king\" and \"man\" captures the concept of \"royalty.\" Adding that difference to \"woman\" lands near \"queen.\" This demonstrates that embeddings encode relationships, not just categories."

      "question": "Do embeddings understand meaning the way humans do? If 'cat' and 'dog' are close in vector space, does the model 'know' they are both animals?",
      "answer": "No. Embeddings capture **statistical co-occurrence patterns** from training data. \"Cat\" and \"dog\" appear in similar contexts (sentences about pets, animals, veterinarians), so they end up near each other in vector space. The model does not have a concept of \"animal\" -- it has a region of vector space where animal-related tokens cluster because they are used in similar ways. This is a statistical echo of meaning, not meaning itself."

      "content": "### How embeddings are created\n\nAn **embedding model** (different from a chat model) converts text into vectors. Common embedding models include:\n\n- **OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002** (1536 dimensions)\n- **Cohere Embed** (1024 dimensions)\n- **sentence-transformers** (open-source, various dimensions)\n\nThe process:\n1. Feed text into the embedding model\n2. The model outputs a fixed-length vector\n3. Store that vector alongside the original text\n\nYou can embed single words, sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents. The granularity you choose affects retrieval quality -- a topic covered in Module 3.4 on chunking.\n\n### Why this matters for context engineering\n\nEmbeddings enable **semantic search**: finding documents based on meaning rather than keywords. Traditional keyword search fails when:\n\n- The query uses different words than the document (\"automobile\" vs. \"car\")\n- The concept is described differently (\"how to fix a slow website\" vs. \"performance optimization techniques\")\n- The relationship is conceptual rather than lexical\n\nWith embeddings, you convert both the query and all documents into vectors, then find the documents whose vectors are closest to the query vector. This is the foundation of the RAG pipeline you will build in Module 3.3."

      "title": "Think of two phrases that mean the same thing but use completely different words (for example, 'I am exhausted' and 'I have no energy left'). Now think of two phrases that share a keyword but mean different things ('bank of the river' and 'bank account'). How would keyword search handle each pair? How would embedding-based search handle them?",
      "solution": "**Same meaning, different words**: Keyword search would fail (no shared keywords between \"I am exhausted\" and \"I have no energy left\"). Embedding search would succeed because both phrases would be close in vector space -- they appear in similar contexts in training data.\n\n**Same keyword, different meanings**: Keyword search would incorrectly match them (both contain \"bank\"). Embedding search would correctly separate them because the surrounding context (\"river\" vs. \"account\") pushes the embeddings into different regions of vector space. This disambiguation is called **contextual embedding** -- the meaning of \"bank\" depends on its context."
