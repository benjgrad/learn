The three broad approaches:\n\n### 1. Fundamental Bottom-Up\n\nStart with individual company analysis:\n- **Intrinsic value estimation**: DCF, residual income, relative valuation\n- **Competitive advantage analysis**: Moats, pricing power, barriers to entry\n- **Management quality**: Capital allocation track record, incentive alignment\n- **Catalyst identification**: What will cause the market to re-rate the stock?\n\nTypical characteristics:\n- Concentrated portfolios (20-50 holdings)\n- High conviction, longer holding periods\n- Higher active share, potentially higher tracking error\n\n### 2. Fundamental Top-Down\n\nStart with macro/sector themes, then select securities:\n- **Macro overlay**: GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, policy\n- **Sector/industry rotation**: Overweight sectors expected to benefit from macro trends\n- **Geographic allocation**: Country/region tilts based on relative attractiveness\n- **Thematic investing**: Structural trends (demographics, technology disruption)\n\nTypical: Broader portfolios, shorter holding periods for tactical positions"

      "question": "A quantitative equity manager's factor model shows strong backtested returns for a 'quality-minus-junk' factor over 30 years. Should you expect this alpha to persist going forward?",
      "answer": "Persistence is uncertain and likely diminished. Considerations: (1) Backtested returns suffer from look-ahead bias and overfitting -- the factor was likely selected because it worked historically. (2) Factor crowding -- as more quant managers adopt similar factors, the premium gets arbitraged away. (3) However, if the factor has a risk-based or behavioral explanation (quality stocks may have lower downside risk, behavioral biases cause investors to underprice quality), some premium may persist. (4) Transaction costs and implementation shortfall are often understated in backtests. (5) Factor returns are cyclical -- quality underperformed in the post-GFC recovery when junk rallied. Expect a reduced but potentially non-zero premium."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Strategy Evaluation\n\nYou are evaluating two equity managers for a $200M allocation:\n\nManager A: Fundamental bottom-up, concentrated (25 stocks), active share 88%, tracking error 7%, information ratio 0.65, 5-year track record.\n\nManager B: Quantitative multi-factor, diversified (300 stocks), active share 55%, tracking error 3%, information ratio 0.85, 10-year track record.\n\nA) Compare the expected alpha of each manager.\nB) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.\nC) How would you allocate between them, and what risks should you monitor?",
      "solution": "**A) Expected Alpha Comparison:**\n\nExpected alpha = Information Ratio x Tracking Error\n- Manager A: 0.65 x 7% = 4.55%\n- Manager B: 0.85 x 3% = 2.55%\n\nManager A has higher expected alpha in absolute terms, but with much higher tracking error (risk). Manager B generates more alpha per unit of active risk.\n\n**B) Advantages and Disadvantages:**\n\n**Manager A (Fundamental):**\n- Advantages: High active share suggests truly active management (not closet indexing); concentrated positions allow deep research; can identify company-specific catalysts; less susceptible to factor crowding\n- Disadvantages: Higher tracking error increases probability of significant underperformance; shorter track record; key-person risk; limited diversification; capacity-constrained\n\n**Manager B (Quantitative):**\n- Advantages: Higher IR (more efficient); longer track record; diversified across 300 names reduces idiosyncratic risk; systematic process is repeatable and scalable; lower transaction costs per position\n- Disadvantages: Lower active share means returns are more benchmark-like; factor crowding risk; model risk (backtested relationships may break down); less ability to identify unique catalysts; may underperform when factors are out of favor\n\n**C) Allocation and Risk Monitoring:**\n\nRecommended allocation: 60% Manager B / 40% Manager A ($120M / $80M)\n\nRationale: Use the quant manager as the core (higher IR, diversified, consistent) and the fundamental manager as a high-conviction complement. The two strategies have low correlation of active returns (different alpha sources), so the combined portfolio benefits from diversification of active risk.\n\nMonitor:\n- Manager A: Style drift (does active share remain high?), position concentration risk, maximum drawdown vs peers\n- Manager B: Factor exposure consistency, factor crowding indicators, model turnover (too many model changes suggests overfitting)\n- Combined: Total tracking error, overlap of positions, correlation of active returns between managers"

          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "High active share (90%) indicates holdings differ significantly from the benchmark -- this is not a closet indexer (A). However, the low tracking error (1.5%) is unusual for such high active share. This combination suggests the manager picks different stocks than the benchmark (high active share) but maintains similar sector/factor weights, causing the portfolio to behave similarly to the benchmark in aggregate (low tracking error). This is characteristic of a diversified stock picker. Option B would typically show moderate active share with low tracking error.",

While the value and quality factors might benefit modestly from a reversal, momentum crashes are typically violent and concentrated, often overwhelming the more gradual benefits from other factors. The March 2009 and January 2021 periods are examples of momentum crashes that caused significant losses for multi-factor quant managers. Factor diversification helps in normal conditions but may not fully offset extreme momentum losses.",
