      "answer": "This unusual combination -- low active share but moderate tracking error -- suggests the portfolio has few stock-specific bets but significant factor/sector tilts. The holdings are similar to the benchmark (low active share), but the portfolio has large sector overweights/underweights or style tilts that create tracking error. This is characteristic of a top-down or factor-tilted manager, not a stock picker. It could also indicate the portfolio is making concentrated sector bets (e.g., significantly overweighting energy) that create tracking error without changing many individual holdings. This is the opposite of a diversified stock picker (high active share, low tracking error)."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Portfolio Construction Analysis\n\nA fundamental equity manager presents the following portfolio characteristics:\n- 35 holdings, active share 82%, tracking error 6.5%\n- Information ratio: 0.55 (3-year)\n- Factor exposures vs benchmark: Value +0.4, Momentum -0.3, Size -0.2, Quality +0.1\n- Top 5 positions represent 35% of the portfolio\n- Annual turnover: 80%\n\nA) Decompose the sources of active risk.\nB) Identify potential construction issues.\nC) Recommend specific improvements to portfolio construction.",
      "solution": "**A) Active Risk Decomposition:**\n\nWith tracking error of 6.5% and moderate factor tilts:\n- Factor-related active risk (estimated): The value tilt (+0.4) and momentum tilt (-0.3) are significant. Value and momentum tend to be negatively correlated, partially offsetting each other. Estimated factor contribution to tracking error: approximately 3-4%\n- Stock-specific active risk: Remaining ~4-5% from individual security selection\n- Concentration risk: Top 5 at 35% (average 7% each) creates significant idiosyncratic risk\n\nThe split is roughly 40-50% factor-driven and 50-60% stock-specific. For a fundamental bottom-up manager claiming stock-picking skill, too much risk comes from factor exposures.\n\n**B) Potential Construction Issues:**\n\n1. **Unintended momentum underweight**: The -0.3 momentum exposure suggests the manager is systematically buying stocks with poor recent performance. This is common for value managers but drags returns in trending markets\n2. **Excessive concentration**: Top 5 at 35% creates outsized single-stock risk; a -20% move in any top holding costs 1.4-2% portfolio return\n3. **High turnover for a fundamental manager**: 80% annual turnover is high for 35 holdings (implies ~2-year average holding period). Combined with 6.5% tracking error, this generates significant transaction costs that erode alpha\n4. **Factor bet mismatch**: If the manager's skill is stock selection, the value/momentum factor bets are consuming active risk budget that should go to idiosyncratic positions\n\n**C) Recommended Improvements:**\n\n1. **Neutralize momentum exposure**: Use an optimizer constraint to keep momentum exposure within +/-0.1. This reduces unintended factor risk without eliminating the value tilt (which may be intentional)\n2. **Reduce concentration**: Cap maximum position size at 5% (from current ~7%+ for top holdings). Reallocate to lower-conviction positions or increase the number of holdings to 40-45\n3. **Add transaction cost penalty to optimization**: Targeting 40-50% turnover would save approximately 50-80 bps annually in implementation costs\n4. **Monitor factor attribution**: Separate factor alpha from stock-selection alpha monthly. If factor timing alpha is consistently negative, fully neutralize all factor exposures\n\nExpected impact: Reduce tracking error to ~5% while maintaining alpha, improving IR from 0.55 to approximately 0.70."

A common guideline is that a position should not exceed 5-10 days of ADV to ensure reasonable liquidity. 30 days of ADV means: (1) building the position will create significant market impact, pushing the stock price up and eroding the expected alpha, (2) exiting under stress could take weeks, (3) the manager is effectively a liquidity provider, not a liquidity taker. Option A is incorrect -- 3% expected alpha for a 12% position is reasonable. Option C is a concern but secondary to the liquidity issue, which could make the position untradeable.",
