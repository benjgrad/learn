      "question": "A risk-parity fund has been leveraged 2.5x to achieve a 7% expected return. During a liquidity crisis, borrowing costs spike and bond-equity correlations increase to 0.7 (from the usual 0.1). What happens to this fund?",
      "answer": "The fund faces a double crisis. First, increased correlations mean the diversification benefit that risk parity relies on collapses -- bonds and equities sell off together, so the portfolio's realized volatility is much higher than the model predicted. Second, with 2.5x leverage, losses are amplified. Third, spiking borrowing costs increase the carry cost of leverage, directly reducing returns. Fourth, the fund may face margin calls, forcing liquidation at the worst time. This scenario is the primary critique of leveraged risk parity -- it can fail precisely when its diversification assumptions break down, which tends to happen during crises when you need diversification most. The 2020 COVID crash illustrated this dynamic."

Increases equity after gains, reduces after losses.\n- **Volatility targeting**: Scale exposure inversely to realized volatility\n- **Momentum-based**: Overweight asset classes with positive trends\n\n## Portable Alpha\n\nSeparate alpha generation from beta exposure:\n\n1.

The board requires a minimum 7.5% nominal return. Current allocation: 55% US equity, 15% international equity, 25% fixed income, 5% cash.\n\nA) Critique the current allocation relative to the return objective.\nB) Propose a risk-parity-informed reallocation that includes alternatives.\nC) Design a portable alpha strategy for the fixed income allocation.",
      "solution": "**A) Critique of Current Allocation:**\n\nReturn requirement: 7.5% nominal (5% spending + 2.5% inflation)\n\nCurrent allocation issues:\n- 70% equity concentration means ~90% of portfolio risk comes from equity, making the endowment essentially a leveraged equity bet\n- 25% fixed income at current yields (~4-5%) drags expected return\n- 5% cash is dead weight for a long-horizon investor\n- No alternatives (private equity, real estate, real assets) -- missing diversification and illiquidity premium\n- Expected return estimate: 0.55(9%) + 0.15(8%) + 0.25(4.5%) + 0.05(3%) = 4.95 + 1.20 + 1.125 + 0.15 = 7.425%, barely meeting the target with no margin of safety\n\n**B) Risk-Parity-Informed Reallocation:**\n\nProposed allocation:\n- US equity: 25% (reduced)\n- International equity: 15% (maintained)\n- Private equity: 12% (new, illiquidity premium)\n- Fixed income (leveraged): 20% nominal, 40% effective via leverage\n- Real assets (real estate, infrastructure, commodities): 15%\n- Hedge funds (diversified alpha): 10%\n- Cash: 3%\n\nRisk contribution target: Equity-related risk ~40%, rates risk ~25%, real assets ~20%, alternatives ~15%\n\nKey design principles:\n- Leverage bonds to equalize their risk contribution (risk parity concept) without full 2-3x leverage\n- Include alternatives for illiquidity premium (PE) and inflation protection (real assets)\n- Hedge funds provide alpha with low beta\n- Expected return: 0.25(9%) + 0.15(8%) + 0.12(13%) + 0.20(4.5%) + 0.15(7%) + 0.10(6%) + 0.03(3%) + leverage contribution = approximately 8.0-8.5%\n\n**C) Portable Alpha Strategy for Fixed Income:**\n\nInstead of holding $400M in passive bonds:\n1. Obtain bond beta via $400M notional in Treasury futures (marginal requirement ~5%, or $20M)\n2. Invest the freed-up $380M in an alpha strategy:\n   - $200M in a market-neutral equity strategy (expected alpha: 3-4%)\n   - $180M in a credit long/short strategy (expected alpha: 2-3%)\n3. Expected total return: Bond beta (4.5%) + Alpha (2.5-3.5%) - Futures roll cost (0.2%) - Management fees (1.0%) = approximately 5.8-6.8%\n4. This adds 1.3-2.3% return above passive bonds without changing the portfolio's rate exposure\n\nRisks to monitor: Alpha strategy drawdowns (could coincide with rate losses), futures roll cost variability, margin management, correlation between alpha strategies and bond returns"

If the portfolio drops to $90M, the new equity allocation would be: 4 x ($90M - $80M) = $40M, requiring selling $40M of equity.

In 2008, equities, credit, commodities, and even some government bonds sold off simultaneously as investors deleveraged. Risk parity models using historical correlations (typically 0.0 to 0.3 for stock-bond) dramatically understated true risk in the crisis. Combined with leverage, this caused losses far exceeding model predictions. Option A is backwards (leverage amplified losses).
