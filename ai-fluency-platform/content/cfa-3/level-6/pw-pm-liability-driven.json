The benchmark is not a market index but the present value of the liabilities themselves.\n\n### Cash Flow Matching\n\nThe simplest LDI approach: purchase bonds whose cash flows exactly replicate the liability schedule.\n\n- **Advantages**: Eliminates reinvestment risk and price risk\n- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, may require exact maturities that don't exist, inflexible\n- **Implementation**: Start with the final liability and work backward, selecting bonds whose coupons and maturities produce the required cash flows\n\n### Duration Matching (Immunization)\n\nFor a **single liability**, immunization requires:\n\n1. **PV of assets >= PV of liabilities** (initial surplus condition)\n2. **Macaulay duration of assets = investment horizon** (duration match)\n3. **Portfolio minimizes dispersion** around the liability date\n\nThe key insight: when duration is matched, the **reinvestment risk** and **price risk** from a parallel yield curve shift offset each other.\n\n$$\\text{BPV}_{\\text{assets}} = \\text{BPV}_{\\text{liabilities}}$$\n\nWhere BPV (basis point value) = Modified Duration x Portfolio Value x 0.0001"

      "question": "A portfolio immunized against a single liability has a Macaulay duration of 7 years matching the liability horizon. If the yield curve undergoes a steepening twist (short rates fall, long rates rise), is the immunization still effective?",
      "answer": "No. Classical single-liability immunization assumes parallel yield curve shifts. A steepening twist is a non-parallel shift that can break the immunization. The short-duration assets gain less from falling short rates than the long-duration assets lose from rising long rates (or vice versa). This is why minimizing dispersion (concentration of cash flows around the horizon) is the third immunization condition -- it reduces exposure to non-parallel shifts."

      "content": "## Multiple Liability Immunization\n\nWhen liabilities occur at multiple dates, the conditions become stricter:\n\n1. **PV of assets >= PV of liabilities**\n2. **BPV of assets = BPV of liabilities** (aggregate duration match)\n3. **Dispersion of asset cash flows >= dispersion of liability cash flows** (asset cash flows must bracket the liability cash flows in time)\n4. **Minimize convexity** of the asset portfolio (reduces structural risk)\n\n### Contingent Immunization\n\nA hybrid approach that combines **active management** with a **safety net**:\n\n- Start with a surplus above the immunization requirement\n- Actively manage as long as the surplus remains positive\n- If the surplus erodes to zero, switch to full immunization\n\n$$\\text{Surplus} = \\text{PV(Assets)} - \\text{PV(Liabilities)}$$\n\nThe manager has a **cushion spread** -- the difference between the portfolio's expected return and the immunization rate.\n\n## Derivatives Overlay for LDI\n\nInterest rate swaps and futures can adjust portfolio duration without trading bonds:\n\n$$N_{\\text{futures}} = \\frac{(\\text{BPV}_{\\text{target}} - \\text{BPV}_{\\text{portfolio}})}{\\text{BPV}_{\\text{futures}}}$$\n\n- **Receive-fixed swaps** increase duration (pension funds often use these)\n- **Pay-fixed swaps** decrease duration\n- **Advantages**: Lower transaction costs, greater liquidity, no need to liquidate existing positions\n\n## Index-Based Fixed Income Strategies\n\nFor investors who want broad market exposure aligned with liabilities:\n\n| Strategy | Description | Tracking Error |\n|---|---|---|\n| Pure indexing | Full replication | Minimal |\n| Enhanced indexing | Minor active tilts | Low |\n| Active management | Significant deviations | Higher |\n\nIndex selection should consider duration profile, credit quality, sector weights, and alignment with liability characteristics."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Design an LDI Strategy\n\nA corporate pension fund has the following liability profile:\n- $50M due in 5 years\n- $80M due in 10 years\n- $120M due in 20 years\n\nCurrent portfolio value: $230M. Discount rate: 4%. The plan sponsor wants to minimize cost while maintaining a high probability of meeting all obligations.\n\nA) Calculate the present value of the liabilities.\nB) Recommend and justify an LDI approach.\nC) Explain how you would use derivatives to manage duration.",
      "solution": "**A) Present Value of Liabilities:**\n\n- PV of $50M at 5 years: $50M / (1.04)^5 = $41.10M\n- PV of $80M at 10 years: $80M / (1.04)^10 = $54.05M\n- PV of $120M at 20 years: $120M / (1.04)^20 = $54.78M\n- Total PV of liabilities: $149.93M\n\nThe surplus is $230M - $149.93M = $80.07M, a significant cushion.\n\n**B) Recommended Approach: Contingent Immunization**\n\nGiven the large surplus ($80.07M, or ~53% of liability PV), contingent immunization is appropriate:\n- The surplus provides a substantial cushion for active management\n- Active management can potentially generate additional returns to fund future benefit increases\n- If the surplus erodes to a predetermined trigger (e.g., $10M), switch to full cash flow matching\n- This balances cost efficiency (active returns) with safety (immunization floor)\n\nAlternative: A laddered cash flow matching approach for the $50M liability (nearest) combined with duration matching for the longer-dated liabilities would be more conservative but sacrifice upside.\n\n**C) Derivatives Overlay:**\n\nCalculate the BPV of liabilities using each cash flow's modified duration. Use receive-fixed interest rate swaps to increase portfolio duration to match liability duration without selling shorter-duration bonds. The notional amount should be set so that:\n\nBPV(portfolio bonds) + BPV(swap overlay) = BPV(liabilities)\n\nSwaps are preferable to futures here because of the long liability horizon (20 years) -- swap tenors can extend to 30 years, while futures are liquid mainly out to 10 years. Use a combination of 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year swaps to match the key rate duration profile of the liabilities."

          "question": "An immunized portfolio for a single liability has the following characteristics: portfolio Macaulay duration = 8 years, liability horizon = 8 years, portfolio convexity = 85. If the portfolio is restructured to increase convexity to 120 while maintaining the same duration, what is the most likely effect?",
          "options": [
            "A) The portfolio becomes better immunized against parallel shifts",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Higher convexity in an immunized portfolio means the cash flows are more dispersed around the liability date. While increased convexity improves performance for large parallel shifts (option A is a distractor), the primary concern in immunization is structural risk from non-parallel shifts. Greater dispersion means more cash flows at dates far from the liability horizon, increasing vulnerability to yield curve twists and butterflies. Option C is incorrect because convexity adjustment is a risk/structure change, not a return enhancement.",

          "explanation": "With the surplus declining from $15M to $2M in just three months, the cushion has been nearly eliminated. The prudent action is to immunize immediately. Option A is dangerous because the remaining $2M cushion provides very little room for further losses. Option C compounds the problem by increasing risk when the safety margin is nearly gone. Contingent immunization requires switching to full immunization when the surplus reaches the predetermined minimum -- this rapid erosion suggests that threshold has been reached or is imminent.",
