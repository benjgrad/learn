      "question": "A BB-rated bond trades at a spread of 350 bps. Historical average default rate for BB bonds is 1.5% annually, with average recovery of 40%. Is this bond's spread attractive relative to its expected credit loss?",
      "answer": "Expected annual credit loss = PD x LGD = 1.5% x (1 - 40%) = 1.5% x 60% = 0.90% or 90 bps. The spread of 350 bps significantly exceeds the 90 bps expected loss, providing a 260 bps cushion for risk premium and liquidity. This appears attractive, but consider: (1) historical averages may understate forward-looking risk if the credit cycle is deteriorating, (2) the specific issuer may have higher-than-average default risk for its rating, and (3) the spread should also compensate for spread volatility and illiquidity. Generally, a spread-to-expected-loss ratio above 3x (here: 350/90 = 3.9x) suggests reasonable compensation."

Current allocation: 40% financials, 25% industrials, 20% utilities, 15% technology. Duration: 5.5 years. Average spread: 120 bps.\n\nEconomic indicators suggest the economy is transitioning from late expansion to early contraction. Recent data: PMI declining below 50, unemployment claims rising, yield curve inverted.\n\nA) Identify the key credit risks in this environment.\nB) Propose specific sector and quality adjustments.\nC) Describe how you would use CDS to hedge the portfolio's most vulnerable positions.",
      "solution": "**A) Key Credit Risks:**\n\n1. **Spread widening**: Transition to contraction typically causes 50-150 bps spread widening in IG\n2. **Rating migration**: Downgrades accelerate, especially BBB- credits at risk of falling to HY (\"fallen angels\")\n3. **Financials exposure**: 40% allocation to financials is risky in early contraction; banks face rising loan losses\n4. **Cyclical sector risk**: Industrial cyclicals face revenue/margin pressure\n5. **Liquidity deterioration**: Bid-ask spreads widen, making repositioning more expensive\n\n**B) Sector and Quality Adjustments:**\n\n- **Reduce financials from 40% to 25%**: Sell lower-rated bank and insurance holdings; retain systemically important banks with strong capital ratios\n- **Reduce industrials from 25% to 15%**: Exit cyclical industrials (autos, metals, chemicals); retain defensive industrials (defense, waste management)\n- **Increase utilities from 20% to 30%**: Regulated utilities offer stable cash flows and defensive characteristics\n- **Maintain technology at 15%**: Focus on large-cap, net-cash-position names\n- **Add Treasuries/agencies: 15%**: Raise overall credit quality and provide liquidity buffer\n- **Quality shift**: Move average rating from A/BBB+ to A+/AA-; eliminate all BBB- exposure\n- **Shorten duration from 5.5 to 4.5 years**: Reduce spread duration to limit mark-to-market losses\n\n**C) CDS Hedging Strategy:**\n\n1. **Buy IG CDX index protection** ($100M notional) to hedge broad spread widening -- provides portfolio-level hedge at lower cost than single-name CDS\n2. **Buy single-name CDS** on the 3-5 most vulnerable financial holdings where selling cash bonds would create excessive market impact\n3. **Consider selling protection on strong defensive names** (utilities) to partially fund the hedge cost\n4. Net hedging cost approximately 60-80 bps annually, but provides downside protection of potentially 200+ bps in spread widening"

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "CDS-bond basis = CDS spread - Z-spread = 180 - 220 = -40 bps. A negative basis means CDS protection costs less than the bond spread implies. This suggests CDS protection is 'cheap' relative to the cash bond. An investor could exploit this via a negative basis trade: buy the bond (earn 220 bps spread) and buy CDS protection (pay 180 bps), locking in a 40 bps spread while being hedged against default. Option A incorrectly describes the CDS as expensive. Option C describes the bond as cheap, which is an alternative interpretation but less precise -- the key insight is that CDS protection is attractively priced.",

In late expansion (B), downgrades may begin for the weakest credits, but the bulk of fallen angel activity occurs after the recession starts. This creates forced selling by IG-only mandates, further depressing prices -- a dynamic that creates opportunities for HY managers.",
