          "question": "A pension fund's fixed income manager is implementing a liability-driven investing (LDI) strategy. The fund's liabilities have a present value of $800 million, a modified duration of 14 years, and a convexity of 280. The manager constructs a hedging portfolio with a modified duration of 14 years but a convexity of 220. What risk remains in this hedge?",
          "options": [
            "A) The hedge is adequate because duration is matched; convexity differences are immaterial",
            "B) The convexity mismatch means the hedging portfolio will underperform relative to liabilities for large parallel rate changes in either direction, leaving the fund exposed to surplus volatility from large rate movements",
            "C) The convexity mismatch only matters if rates decrease, not if rates increase"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "When the hedging assets have lower convexity than the liabilities (220 < 280), a large parallel rate shift in either direction will cause the liabilities to change more in value than the assets. For a rate increase, liabilities fall less than assets (asset value drops more). For a rate decrease, liabilities rise more than assets (asset value increases less). In both cases, the surplus (assets minus liabilities) deteriorates. This creates surplus volatility that the duration match alone does not eliminate. Option A ignores convexity risk. Option C is incorrect because convexity effects are symmetric for parallel shifts.",

Which bond is more attractive on a relative value basis?",

            "A) Bond A, because the wider spread provides more compensation and industrials typically outperform in a slowdown",

Bond B's A- rating provides more protection in a deteriorating economic environment. While Bond A offers a higher spread (120 vs. 95 bps), this spread may not adequately compensate for the increased downgrade and default risk in a slowdown.

The current high-yield spread over Treasuries is 350 bps, compared to a 10-year average of 450 bps. The manager expects a modest economic slowdown. Which assessment is most accurate?",
          "options": [
            "A) The tight spread (350 bps vs. 450 bps average) suggests high-yield bonds are expensive and offer inadequate compensation for the increased default risk expected in a slowdown",

          "explanation": "With spreads 100 bps tighter than the 10-year average and an expected economic slowdown, the risk-reward of high-yield bonds is unattractive. Tight spreads mean less cushion against rising defaults and spread widening that typically accompany a slowdown. Historically, high-yield spreads tend to widen during economic deterioration, and the below-average starting spread amplifies the potential for negative excess returns. Option B assumes a permanent structural change without evidence. Option C misapplies mean reversion (spreads would need to widen toward the average, not tighten further).",

            "A) The 130/30 structure doubles the portfolio's expected return through leverage",
            "B) The 130/30 structure allows the manager to express negative views through short positions, expanding the breadth of active decisions and potentially improving the information ratio",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The 130/30 structure's primary advantage is expanding the manager's opportunity set. In a long-only portfolio, the manager can only express negative views by underweighting a stock (maximum underweight is the benchmark weight, often just 1-2%). With short selling, the manager can take meaningful negative positions, allowing more active decisions and greater differentiation from the benchmark. By the fundamental law of active management ($IR = IC \\times \\sqrt{BR}$), increased breadth (BR) improves the expected information ratio. Option A is incorrect; the 130/30 has 100% net exposure, same as long-only, so market return is not doubled. Option C is incorrect because the net exposure is 100%, providing no market hedge.",

The BB bonds have much higher spread sensitivity and default risk than BBB bonds, so the barbell's performance is more volatile. When spreads narrow, the BB component benefits disproportionately.

A typical unlevered risk parity portfolio might be 70-80% fixed income and 20-30% equities, producing a low expected return. To achieve return targets comparable to a 60/40 portfolio, risk parity strategies typically use leverage to scale up the entire portfolio. Option A is incorrect; risk parity and MVO produce different allocations unless asset classes happen to have identical Sharpe ratios.

However, the 10% cash allocation is a significant weakness. Cash earns close to the risk-free rate, contributing little to the surplus return target. It also does not match liability duration (cash has near-zero duration vs. the 8-year liability duration), so it actually hurts the liability hedge by reducing the overall portfolio duration below the liability duration.

The net carry is 50 bps ($250 - 200$) with the credit risk fully hedged by the CDS. If the basis converges (i.e., the cash spread tightens relative to the CDS spread), the trade profits from both the carry and the mark-to-market convergence. The risk is that the basis widens further (cash bond spreads widen more than CDS) or that there are technical delivery/settlement issues. Option B is the opposite trade (positive basis trade). Option C takes unhedged credit risk.",

          "options": [

          "explanation": "Optimization-based approaches are well-known for their sensitivity to input assumptions. Small changes in expected return estimates can produce large changes in optimal weights, potentially leading to concentrated, unstable portfolios. This 'error maximization' property of MVO is a significant source of model risk. Approach 2 (stratified sampling) is less dependent on estimated inputs because it matches observable characteristics (sector weights, factor exposures) without optimizing expected returns, making it more robust to estimation error. However, the alpha overlays in Approach 2 still introduce some model risk. Option B identifies a minor concern. Option C incorrectly equates tracking error targets with model risk.",

          "question": "A multi-asset manager is implementing a tactical asset allocation (TAA) overlay. The current strategic allocation is 55% equities, 35% bonds, 10% alternatives. The TAA model signals an equity overweight. The manager increases equity to 65% by reducing bonds to 25%. The TAA bet is funded entirely by selling government bonds. What unintended consequence might this create?",

            "A) No unintended consequences; TAA is simply adjusting the equity/bond mix",

Reducing government bonds from 35% to 25% not only increases equity exposure but also reduces the portfolio's interest rate duration. For an investor with interest-rate-sensitive liabilities (e.g., a pension fund), this reduction increases surplus risk. The TAA overlay should ideally be implemented in a way that isolates the intended bet (equity market view) from unintended consequences (duration change).
