      "question": "A portfolio manager has a barbell portfolio (2-year and 30-year bonds) and a bullet portfolio (10-year bonds), both with the same duration. If the yield curve experiences a positive butterfly (intermediate rates rise, short and long rates fall), which portfolio outperforms?",
      "answer": "The barbell outperforms. In a positive butterfly, short and long rates fall (benefiting the barbell's 2-year and 30-year positions) while intermediate rates rise (hurting the bullet's 10-year position). The barbell has positive exposure to the butterfly -- it profits when the curve becomes more curved. The bullet has negative butterfly exposure. This illustrates why duration matching alone is insufficient for comparing strategies; you must also consider exposure to slope and curvature changes."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Yield Curve Strategy Recommendation\n\nEconomic analysis suggests the following over the next 6 months:\n- Central bank expected to raise the policy rate by 75 bps\n- Inflation expectations declining, long-term rates expected to fall 25 bps\n- Credit spreads expected to widen modestly\n\nYour client's fixed income portfolio currently has a duration of 6 years with a laddered structure. Current yield: 4.5%.\n\nA) Describe the expected yield curve movement.\nB) Recommend a specific repositioning strategy.\nC) Calculate the approximate expected return if long rates fall 25 bps and the portfolio is repositioned to a duration of 8 years (assume roll-down of 15 bps and credit loss of 5 bps over the period).",
      "solution": "**A) Expected Yield Curve Movement:**\n\nThe curve is expected to flatten significantly:\n- Short end: +75 bps from policy rate hikes\n- Long end: -25 bps from declining inflation expectations\n- Net flattening: approximately 100 bps\n\nThis is a bear-flattening scenario (short rates rise more than long rates fall).\n\n**B) Recommended Strategy:**\n\nShift from the ladder to a barbell/long-duration bias:\n1. Extend duration from 6 to 8+ years by overweighting the long end\n2. Reduce intermediate maturities (the belly of the curve may underperform)\n3. Consider a barbell with short-term cash equivalents (to be reinvested at higher short rates) and long-term bonds (to benefit from falling long rates)\n4. Reduce credit exposure given expected spread widening -- favor government bonds\n5. Use receive-fixed interest rate swaps at the long end to add duration efficiently\n\n**C) Approximate Expected Return (6-month, annualized basis):**\n\nYield income: 4.5% / 2 = 2.25% (6 months)\nRoll-down return: 15 bps = 0.15%\nPrice appreciation from yield decline: Duration x Yield change = 8 x 0.25% = 2.00%\nCredit losses: -0.05%\n\nTotal expected return (6-month): 2.25% + 0.15% + 2.00% - 0.05% = 4.35%\n\nAnnualized: approximately 8.7%\n\nNote: This assumes the repositioning is done before the rate changes materialize and ignores transaction costs of restructuring."

          "explanation": "For a parallel shift, duration is the primary determinant of return, so both portfolios lose approximately the same amount from the duration effect (5 x 0.50% = 2.50% price decline). However, convexity provides a secondary benefit: the higher convexity of the barbell (55 vs 30) means it loses slightly less. Convexity adjustment = 0.5 x Convexity x (yield change)^2. For B: 0.5 x 55 x 0.005^2 = 0.069%. For A: 0.5 x 30 x 0.005^2 = 0.038%. Portfolio B outperforms by approximately 3 bps. Option C ignores the convexity effect.",

After one year, the 7-year bond becomes a 6-year bond at a yield of 4.0% (a 20 bps decline). The price gain from the 20 bps yield decline on a bond with approximately 6 years modified duration: 6 x 0.20% = 1.20%. However, the roll-down return is the price appreciation component only: approximately 6 x 0.20% = 1.20%. Adding the yield income of 4.2% gives total return of ~5.4%. But the question asks specifically for roll-down return (price appreciation from curve roll), which is approximately 1.20%. Actually, including the carry: The total excess return from carrying the position includes carry (4.2% yield earned) and roll (1.20% price gain). The roll-down return specifically is the price change from moving along the curve = Modified Duration x yield change = ~6 x 0.20% = 1.20%. The answer is B at 1.20%.",
