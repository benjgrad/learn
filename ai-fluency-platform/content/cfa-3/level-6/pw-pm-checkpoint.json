After a parallel yield shift, the immunization holds. However, a subsequent yield curve twist causes a $1.2M shortfall. The most likely explanation is:",

            "A) The portfolio's convexity was too low",

            "C) The portfolio's duration drifted due to the passage of time"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "For single-liability immunization, high cash flow dispersion (widely spread maturities) increases vulnerability to non-parallel yield curve shifts (twists). Even though the parallel shift test passed (duration was matched), the twist exposed the structural risk from having cash flows at maturities far from the 8-year liability horizon. Option A is misleading -- higher convexity actually increases dispersion and would worsen the problem. Option C describes a real concern (duration drift) but would affect parallel shift immunization, which the question states held.",

She constructs a duration-neutral position: long 30-year bonds and short 2-year bonds. The portfolio also has a CDS-bond basis trade (long cash, long protection) on an IG issuer with a negative basis of -30 bps. Which component contributes to return if spreads widen 20 bps?",

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "The yield curve flattener (long 30Y, short 2Y) profits from the expected curve move: long rates falling benefits the long 30Y position, and short rates rising benefits the short 2Y position. This generates positive returns. The basis trade (long cash bond, long CDS protection) is a hedged position that profits from basis convergence, not from spread direction. If spreads widen 20 bps, the cash bond loses value but the CDS protection gains value -- the net P&L depends on the basis change, not the spread level. The spread widening alone doesn't help the basis trade unless it causes the basis to converge.",

The quantitative manager has higher IR (0.80 vs 0.50) but lower expected alpha (3.2% vs 4.0%). Assuming low correlation of active returns between the two managers (different alpha sources), the combined portfolio achieves a higher IR than either alone. Option A would lever the quant to 6% TE (alpha = 4.8%) but concentrates in a single alpha source. Option C has higher alpha (4.0%) but lower IR and concentrates in a single manager with higher key-person risk.

      "title": "Integrated Case Study: Multi-Strategy Portfolio Management\n\nYou are the CIO of a family office managing $500M across three generations. The current allocation is 50% global equity, 30% fixed income, 10% alternatives, 10% cash.\n\nMarket outlook: You expect a late-cycle environment with rising rates, flattening yield curve, widening credit spreads, and equity market volatility increasing.\n\nThe family patriarch (age 78) needs $5M annually. The second generation (ages 45-55) has moderate growth needs. The third generation (ages 18-25) has a very long horizon.\n\nA) How would you restructure the fixed income allocation? Reference specific LDI, yield curve, and credit concepts.\nB) How would you adjust the equity allocation? Reference specific active strategies.\nC) How would you redesign the overall portfolio using multi-asset concepts?\nD) What private wealth considerations affect the implementation?",
      "solution": "**A) Fixed Income Restructuring:**\n\nCurrent 30% ($150M) in FI should be restructured for a rising rate, flattening curve, widening spread environment:\n\n1. Shorten duration from benchmark (~6 years) to 3-4 years to reduce rate sensitivity\n2. Implement a flattener: overweight long bonds (which benefit from flattening) funded by underweighting intermediate maturities. Use a barbell structure.\n3. Reduce credit exposure: Move from IG corporate overweight to government/agency overweight. Credit spreads widen in late cycle. Sell BBB- exposure (fallen angel risk).\n4. Add CDS protection: Buy CDX IG index protection ($50M notional) as portfolio insurance against spread widening\n5. LDI component: Cash flow match the patriarch's $5M annual need for 5 years using a dedicated bond ladder ($25M). This immunizes the spending requirement against rate movements.\n6. Preserve optionality: Hold 2% in TIPS for inflation protection\n\n**B) Equity Allocation Adjustment:**\n\nCurrent 50% ($250M) in global equity, restructured for late-cycle volatility:\n\n1. Reduce beta: Trim total equity to 40% ($200M). Increase quality factor exposure (high ROE, low leverage, stable earnings) as quality outperforms in late cycle.\n2. Shift from growth to value/defensive: Rotate into utilities, healthcare, consumer staples away from high-beta cyclicals\n3. Add active equity overlay: Implement a long/short equity strategy ($50M) that is market-neutral -- captures stock-selection alpha without market exposure\n4. Reduce international equity allocation modestly if dollar strengthening is expected in a rate-hiking environment\n5. Use put spreads on equity indices to provide downside protection at reasonable cost\n\n**C) Multi-Asset Redesign:**\n\nNew allocation: 40% equity, 25% fixed income (including LDI), 5% cash flow matching bonds, 15% alternatives, 10% real assets, 5% cash\n\n- Alternatives (15%): Split between market-neutral hedge funds (10%) and private credit with strong covenants (5%) -- private credit offers premium but select carefully in widening spread environment\n- Real assets (10%): Infrastructure (5%) for inflation protection and stable cash flows; gold/commodities (5%) as late-cycle hedge\n- Dynamic allocation: Implement a volatility-targeting overlay that reduces equity exposure when realized vol exceeds 20% (VIX trigger)\n- Cash (5%): At higher rates, cash earns meaningful return while providing dry powder for opportunities in a downturn\n\n**D) Private Wealth Implementation Considerations:**\n\n1. **Tax management**: The patriarch's $5M spending should come from the most tax-efficient sources (e.g., return of capital, long-term gains at preferential rates). Roth conversions for the second generation while rates are high and portfolio values may be temporarily depressed.\n2. **Multi-generational time horizons**: The LDI component serves the patriarch; the second generation's assets can be moderately allocated; the third generation's share should be aggressively invested (illiquid alternatives, PE, growth equity).\n3. **Estate planning integration**: Any concentrated positions should be addressed now with gifting/trust strategies while values may decline. GRATs are attractive when interest rates are rising.\n4. **Behavioral management**: Late-cycle anxiety may cause family members to demand excessive conservatism. Educate using the goals-based framework -- essential spending is protected by LDI, while aspirational goals can tolerate volatility.\n5. **Liquidity management**: Ensure sufficient liquidity for all three generations' needs before committing to illiquid alternatives."
