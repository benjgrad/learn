      "question": "A portfolio manager wants to reduce the duration of a $1 billion bond portfolio from 7.5 to 5.0. Should they buy or sell bond futures, and why?",
      "answer": "Sell bond futures. Reducing duration means reducing sensitivity to interest rate changes. Selling (shorting) bond futures creates a short position that offsets some of the portfolio's long duration. When rates rise, the short futures position profits, partially offsetting losses on the long bond portfolio. The number of contracts depends on the dollar duration of the portfolio vs. the dollar duration of the futures contract and its cheapest-to-deliver bond."
