      "question": "A manager writes covered calls on a portfolio with a strike 5% above current levels and receives 2% premium. In which market scenario does this strategy underperform owning the stock outright?",
      "answer": "The covered call underperforms in a strong rally \u2014 specifically when the stock rises more than 5% (the strike). The call is exercised, capping the profit at 5% + 2% premium = 7% total return regardless of how far the stock rises. If the stock rallies 15%, the covered call earns 7% vs. 15% for the unhedged position, underperforming by 8%. The strategy outperforms in flat or modestly declining markets (the 2% premium cushion) but sacrifices participation in large upmoves."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Option Strategy Selection",
      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Strategy analysis for the concentrated holding:**\n\nThe most appropriate strategy is a **zero-cost collar**:\n- Buy a put option with strike at $95 (5% below current $100) for downside protection\n- Sell a call option with strike at $115 (15% above current) to finance the put\n- Choose strikes so premiums approximately offset\n\nJustification:\n1. The client has a concentrated position with significant unrealized gains \u2014 liquidating has tax consequences\n2. The collar provides downside protection without requiring sale of shares\n3. Zero-cost structure means no cash outlay for protection\n4. The client retains some upside (up to 15%) before the position is called away\n5. The collar effectively creates a bounded range of outcomes: worst case -5%, best case +15%\n\n**Part B \u2014 Alternative strategies and trade-offs:**\n\n| Strategy | Advantage | Disadvantage |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Protective put only** | Unlimited upside retained | Significant premium cost (2-3% for 6-month ATM put) |\n| **Covered call only** | Income generation | No downside protection; caps upside |\n| **Prepaid forward** | Immediate diversification without sale | Gives up all future return on the position |\n| **Exchange fund** | Diversification without triggering gain | Limited availability, lock-up periods, fund risk |\n\n**Part C \u2014 Collar implementation considerations:**\n\n1. **Strike selection**: Wider collar (lower put strike, higher call strike) gives more participation but less protection. Match strikes to client's risk tolerance.\n2. **Tenor**: Typically 6-12 months; must be rolled at expiration if continued protection is needed\n3. **Tax implications**: The collar may be treated as a constructive sale if strikes are too tight (IRS rules), which would trigger the capital gain the client is trying to defer. Typically need at least 15-20% spread between strikes.\n4. **Margin**: The short call is covered by the underlying position, so no additional margin is required."
