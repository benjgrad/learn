      "question": "If the forward rate for EUR/USD is lower than the spot rate (forward discount on EUR), what does this imply about the cost of hedging for a USD-based investor holding European assets?",
      "answer": "The forward discount on EUR means the investor can sell EUR forward at a rate lower than the current spot rate. This creates a negative hedging return \u2014 the investor gives up the interest rate differential (EUR rates are lower than USD rates, per covered interest rate parity). The 'cost' of hedging equals approximately the interest rate differential: the USD investor earns higher domestic rates but gives this up through the forward. However, this is an opportunity cost, not a direct cash cost \u2014 the unhedged position is exposed to currency risk that may or may not be rewarded."

      "content": "## Passive Hedging with Forward Contracts\n\n### Rolling Forward Hedge\n\nThe most common hedging approach: sell the foreign currency forward on a rolling basis.\n\n**Hedge return** = Forward premium/discount \u2248 $i_{domestic} - i_{foreign}$\n\nIf domestic rates > foreign rates:\n- Forward premium on domestic currency\n- Positive roll yield from hedging (earning the rate differential)\n\nIf domestic rates < foreign rates:\n- Forward discount on domestic currency\n- Negative roll yield from hedging (paying the rate differential)\n\n### Hedge Ratio Considerations\n\n- **Over-hedging risk**: If the foreign asset value falls, the hedge (based on initial value) is too large\n- **Under-hedging risk**: If the foreign asset value rises, the hedge is too small\n- **Dynamic hedging**: Adjust hedge ratio as asset values change (more expensive)\n- **Basis risk**: Hedge maturity may not match portfolio holding period\n\n## Active Currency Strategies\n\n### 1. Carry Trade\n\nBorrow in low-interest-rate currencies, invest in high-interest-rate currencies:\n- Profits if exchange rate movement doesn't offset the interest rate differential\n- **Risk**: \"Carry trade unwinds\" \u2014 sudden, sharp reversals when risk sentiment shifts\n- Carry trades tend to produce **small, frequent gains and large, infrequent losses** (negative skew)\n\n### 2. Momentum Strategies\n\n- Trend-following: currencies that have been appreciating tend to continue\n- Typical holding period: 1-12 months\n- Can be combined with carry for diversification of currency alpha sources\n\n### 3. Valuation-Based Strategies\n\n- Based on purchasing power parity (PPP) deviations\n- Buy undervalued currencies, sell overvalued\n- Long-horizon strategy \u2014 PPP reversion can take years\n\n### 4. Volatility Trading\n\n- Sell options on currencies with high implied vol vs. expected realized vol\n- Straddle/strangle selling to capture volatility risk premium"

      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Strategic hedge ratio recommendation:**\n\nFor the Japanese equity allocation (JPY-denominated):\n- JPY is a safe-haven currency \u2014 tends to strengthen in risk-off episodes when equities fall\n- This creates a **natural hedge**: currency gains partially offset equity losses in downturns\n- Recommendation: Lower hedge ratio (25-50%) to preserve this natural diversification benefit\n\nFor the UK bond allocation (GBP-denominated):\n- Fixed income is held for stability \u2014 adding unhedged currency risk defeats this purpose\n- GBP does not provide a reliable natural hedge for bond returns\n- Recommendation: Higher hedge ratio (75-90%) to preserve the risk-reduction role of bonds\n\n**Part B \u2014 Cost-benefit of hedging:**\n\nCurrent interest rates: USD 5.0%, JPY 0.5%, GBP 4.8%\n\n- **JPY hedge**: Rolling forward at ~4.5% annualized gain (USD > JPY rates). Hedging earns positive carry, making it cheaper in opportunity cost terms. However, the natural hedge benefit argues for less hedging.\n\n- **GBP hedge**: Rolling forward at ~0.2% annualized gain (USD slightly > GBP rates). Very low cost, strong argument for high hedge ratio.\n\n**Part C \u2014 Active currency overlay:**\n\nThe overlay manager should have a risk budget (tracking error limit, e.g., 1.5% annualized) and could implement:\n\n1. **Carry strategy**: Short JPY (lowest rates), long AUD/NZD (higher rates) \u2014 exploits the interest rate differential\n2. **Momentum signals**: If GBP is trending down, increase GBP hedge ratio above strategic; if trending up, reduce\n3. **Valuation triggers**: If JPY becomes significantly undervalued on PPP basis, reduce hedge (expect JPY appreciation)\n\nThe overlay should be evaluated on its incremental risk-adjusted return contribution, measured by information ratio relative to the strategic hedge benchmark."

          "options": [
            "A) Positive, because the forward rate is at a premium to spot",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The forward rate (1.0750) is below the spot rate (1.08), meaning EUR is at a forward discount to USD. The U.S. investor hedging by selling EUR forward receives fewer dollars per euro in the forward market than in the spot market. This negative roll yield reflects the fact that EUR interest rates are higher than USD rates in this example (the forward discount equals the interest rate differential per covered interest rate parity).",
