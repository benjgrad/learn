However, it begins to profit from any movement away from the strike price (beyond the premium paid). A strangle (OTM call + OTM put) is cheaper because both options are out-of-the-money and have lower premiums, but the stock must move past either strike (plus the combined premium) to generate a profit. For a volatility play, the straddle has a lower breakeven move but higher cost; the strangle has a higher breakeven move but lower cost. Option B reverses the cost relationship.

The manager uses a rolling 3-month forward hedge, rolling the hedge each quarter. Interest rates are higher in the US than in Japan. Over time, what is the expected impact of the hedge on portfolio returns?",
          "options": [
            "A) The hedge will earn a positive roll yield because USD interest rates exceed JPY rates, causing the JPY forward price to trade at a premium",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Covered interest rate parity implies that the JPY/USD forward rate reflects the interest rate differential. Since US rates exceed Japanese rates, the forward JPY/USD rate shows JPY at a forward premium (equivalently, USD at a forward discount). The hedger sells JPY forward (buys USD) at a rate that is higher than the expected future spot rate (assuming unbiased expectations).

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The manager wants to hedge credit spread risk only, not interest rate risk. Buying CDS protection on the major credit exposures isolates and hedges the credit risk component. If spreads widen (credit quality deteriorates), the CDS protection gains in value, offsetting losses on the bond portfolio. Importantly, CDS do not directly hedge interest rate risk, which is the manager's intention. Option A hedges interest rate risk (selling futures) but then the CDS hedge is redundant with the goal.

          "explanation": "A prepaid variable forward (PVF) provides the investor with a cash payment upfront (typically 75-90% of the stock value) in exchange for a commitment to deliver shares (or cash equivalent) at a future date. The key advantage for this client is that the tax event is generally deferred until the forward settles (shares are delivered). This satisfies both objectives: immediate liquidity and tax deferral. Option B (exchange fund) provides diversification, not immediate cash liquidity. The investor contributes shares and receives an interest in a diversified pool. Option C (collar) limits risk but does not generate significant cash; the sold call premium only partially offsets the put cost in a zero-cost structure.",

Enter a receive-fixed, pay-floating swap (converts the floating income to fixed income)\n\nThe combined position pays floating on the FRN (offset by paying floating on the swap) and receives fixed from the swap, replicating a fixed-rate bond.

          "question": "A portfolio manager is using equity index futures to equitize a $20 million cash position pending investment in individual securities. The target is full equity exposure (beta = 1.0). After establishing the futures position, the underlying index rises 3% over the next month while the risk-free rate is 0.4% per month. The futures position approximately captures the equity return but the total return on the equitized cash position slightly underperforms the index.

            "A) The basis risk between the futures contract and the specific stocks the manager intends to buy",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "Equitizing cash with index futures introduces two sources of tracking error relative to the desired portfolio: (1) basis risk, because the futures track the index, not the specific stocks the manager plans to buy, and (2) transaction costs and implementation frictions including commissions, bid-ask spreads, and the opportunity cost of maintaining margin. When the target portfolio is a selection of individual securities (not the index itself), basis risk is typically the dominant source. Both factors contribute to the observed underperformance.",

The fund's currency policy calls for hedging 50% of currency exposure using 3-month rolling forward contracts.

In an environment where domestic interest rates are significantly below foreign interest rates, the rolling hedge will most likely generate:",

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "When domestic interest rates are lower than foreign rates, covered interest rate parity dictates that the foreign currency trades at a forward discount (the domestic currency at a forward premium). The hedging fund sells foreign currencies forward at the forward rate, which exceeds what the spot rate would be under unbiased expectations. Each quarter, the fund closes the old forward (which has converged toward spot) and enters a new forward, capturing the differential. This creates systematic positive roll yield.

The trade-off is that upside participation is capped at the call strike. This is appropriate when the committee's primary concern is EUR depreciation but wants to manage hedging costs.
