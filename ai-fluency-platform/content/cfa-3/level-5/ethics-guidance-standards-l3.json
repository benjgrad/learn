      "content": "## Standard I: Professionalism \u2014 Advanced Application\n\n### I(A) Knowledge of the Law\n\n**PM-Level Complexity**:\n- PMs operating across jurisdictions must comply with the **stricter** of local law, CFA Institute Standards, or firm policy\n- When laws conflict between jurisdictions, follow the law of the jurisdiction with the **strictest requirements**\n- If local law permits something that CFA Standards prohibit (e.g., front-running in some jurisdictions), follow CFA Standards\n- **Reporting obligation**: If you discover a violation by a colleague, report it up the chain (to supervisor, compliance, or legal). You are NOT required to report to regulators (unless local law requires it), but you must dissociate from the violation\n\n### I(B) Independence and Objectivity\n\n**Pressure Sources for PMs**:\n\n| Source | Example | Response |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Buy-side pressure** | Large client pressures PM to buy specific stock | Decline; document the request |\n| **Sell-side pressure** | Broker offers lavish gifts for trade flow | Decline or disclose per firm policy |\n| **Internal pressure** | Investment bank division wants favorable coverage | Maintain information barriers (Chinese walls) |\n| **Performance pressure** | Employer pressures PM to take excessive risk | Follow IPS; escalate if pressure persists |\n\n**Gifts and entertainment threshold**: Must be reasonable and customary. Lavish gifts from clients or brokers must be disclosed and may need to be declined. The key test: would acceptance compromise (or appear to compromise) your independence?\n\n### I(C) Misrepresentation\n\n**PM-Level Applications**:\n- Do not guarantee returns or imply certainty about uncertain outcomes\n- Distinguish between facts and opinions in client communications\n- Performance presentations must comply with GIPS (if applicable) or at minimum be fair and complete\n- Do not selectively present favorable time periods or cherry-pick accounts"

      "content": "## Standard III: Duties to Clients \u2014 Advanced Scenarios\n\n### III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care \u2014 Complex Structures\n\n**Who is the client?**\n\n| Structure | Client Is |\n|---|---|\n| Individual account | The individual investor |\n| Pension fund | Plan beneficiaries (NOT the plan sponsor) |\n| Mutual fund | Fund shareholders |\n| Wrap account | End investor (not the wrap sponsor) |\n| Trust | Beneficiaries (per trust terms) |\n| Sub-advisory | End clients of the primary advisor |\n\n**Critical insight**: In a pension fund, the employer (plan sponsor) hires the manager, but the beneficiaries (employees/retirees) are the true clients. If the sponsor's interests conflict with beneficiaries' interests, the PM must prioritize beneficiaries.\n\n### III(B) Fair Dealing \u2014 Dissemination Challenges\n\n**Simultaneous dissemination**: All clients must receive investment recommendations at the same time (or as close as practical).\n\n- If a time-zone difference exists, use electronic distribution to minimize delay\n- If a large institutional client and a small retail client receive the same recommendation, both must receive it simultaneously \u2014 cannot give the large client a head start\n- **Exception**: Clients who pay for specialized services (e.g., detailed research reports) may receive that additional service, but the core recommendation must be disseminated fairly\n\n### III(C) Suitability \u2014 Multi-Account Management\n\nWhen managing many accounts:\n- Maintain an updated IPS for each client\n- A recommendation suitable for one client may be unsuitable for another\n- When managing to a model portfolio, individual client constraints must still be honored (e.g., tax-loss harvesting for taxable accounts, restricted stocks)\n- **Documentation is key**: Record why specific decisions were made for each account"

      "solution": "**Scenario**: Sarah is a PM at a large firm. She discovers that her firm's largest institutional client (a pension fund) has been pressuring the CIO to overweight a specific stock \u2014 the client's own company stock. The CIO has quietly increased the allocation in several portfolios, including the pension fund. Sarah also learns that a junior analyst is moonlighting as an advisor for his friends' personal accounts.\n\n**Part A \u2014 Standards violated by the CIO:**\n\n1. **Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care**: The pension fund's beneficiaries are the true clients, not the plan sponsor (the company). Overweighting the sponsor's own stock is a conflict of interest that harms beneficiaries (concentrated risk in employer stock \u2014 doubly dangerous because if the company fails, both their jobs and pension are at risk).\n\n2. **Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity**: The CIO's investment decision was influenced by client pressure rather than independent investment analysis. The decision lacked an independent, objective basis.\n\n3. **Standard III(C) Suitability**: Overweighting a single stock is likely inconsistent with the pension fund's IPS, which presumably calls for diversification. It may also violate other accounts' IPS where the stock was added.\n\n4. **Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis**: The investment decision was based on client pressure, not thorough analysis. There is no reasonable investment basis for the decision.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Standards violated by the junior analyst:**\n\n1. **Standard IV(A) Loyalty to Employer**: Running a personal advisory practice while employed creates a competing business that must be disclosed to and approved by the employer.\n\n2. **Standard IV(B) Additional Compensation Arrangements**: If the analyst receives any compensation (including gifts) from his friends for advisory services, this must be disclosed to and approved by the employer.\n\n3. Depending on the arrangement, there may also be regulatory violations (unregistered investment advisory activity).\n\n**Part C \u2014 Sarah's obligations:**\n\n1. **Report the CIO's actions** to the compliance department or legal counsel. Standard I(A) requires awareness of and adherence to laws \u2014 if the CIO's actions violate securities laws (e.g., ERISA for the pension fund), Sarah must take action.\n\n2. **Dissociate from the violation**: Sarah should not implement or benefit from the CIO's compromised investment decisions. She should refuse to execute trades she believes violate fiduciary duty.\n\n3. **Report the analyst's situation** to compliance or the analyst's supervisor. The moonlighting must be disclosed and approved.\n\n4. **Document everything**: Record dates, conversations, and actions taken.\n\n5. **Consider escalation**: If internal reporting is unsuccessful, Sarah should consider whether legal obligations require external reporting (e.g., to regulators). She should seek legal counsel.\n\n6. **Ultimately**: If the firm fails to address the violations and Sarah cannot dissociate, she should consider leaving the firm to protect her own professional standing."
