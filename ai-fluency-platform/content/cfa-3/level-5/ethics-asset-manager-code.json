Act ethically and professionally** | Firm commits to ethical conduct in all dealings |\n| **2. Act in clients' interests** | Client interests take precedence over firm interests |\n| **3. Act independently and objectively** | Investment decisions free from external influence |\n| **4. Act with skill, competence, and diligence** | Qualified personnel, thorough analysis |\n| **5. Communicate accurately** | Timely, honest, and complete communication |\n| **6. Uphold capital market rules** | Comply with all applicable regulations |\n\n## Responsibilities to Clients\n\n### A. Loyalty to Clients\n\n- Place client interests before firm interests at all times\n- Conflicts must be disclosed, managed, or eliminated\n- Fair treatment of all clients \u2014 no preferential treatment\n- Protect confidential client information\n\n### B. Investment Process and Actions\n\n- Maintain a **reasonable and adequate basis** for all investment recommendations and actions\n- Consider the **suitability** of each investment for the specific client\n- Conduct a thorough **due diligence** process before investing client assets\n- Use **fair market value** for client portfolio valuations where possible"

      "title": "Constructed Response: Asset Manager Code Application",
      "solution": "**Scenario**: A mid-sized asset management firm wants to adopt the Asset Manager Code. The compliance officer has identified the following gaps in current practices:\n\n1. No written proxy voting policy\n2. Portfolio managers perform their own portfolio valuations\n3. Soft dollar usage is not tracked or disclosed\n4. The firm has no formal business continuity plan\n5. Personal trading is not pre-cleared; employees self-report quarterly\n\n**Part A \u2014 Priority ranking of gaps:**\n\n**Critical (immediate remediation):**\n\n1. **Portfolio managers performing valuations** \u2014 This is the most critical gap. The AMC requires independent valuation to prevent conflicts of interest. PMs who value their own portfolios can overstate performance. Remediation: Establish an independent valuation function (separate team or outsourced third party).\n\n2. **No soft dollar tracking/disclosure** \u2014 Soft dollars are client money. Without tracking, the firm cannot demonstrate that soft dollar usage benefits clients. This violates both the AMC and fiduciary duty. Remediation: Implement a soft dollar tracking system, categorize all goods and services received, and provide quarterly disclosure to clients.\n\n**High Priority (within 30 days):**\n\n3. **Personal trading pre-clearance** \u2014 Self-reporting quarterly is insufficient. Without pre-clearance, employees could front-run client trades or trade on MNPI. Remediation: Implement pre-clearance requirement for all personal trades; establish restricted lists; require duplicate account statements.\n\n**Important (within 90 days):**\n\n4. **Proxy voting policy** \u2014 The AMC requires a written policy for voting proxies in clients' best interest. Remediation: Draft a proxy voting policy (either vote in clients' interest based on guidelines, or disclose that the firm does not vote proxies and give clients the option to vote themselves).\n\n5. **Business continuity plan** \u2014 While critical for operations, this is not a direct client-harm issue. Remediation: Develop BCP covering: backup facilities, data recovery, communication plans, succession for key personnel.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Implementation roadmap:**\n\n- Week 1-2: Establish independent valuation function; begin soft dollar audit\n- Week 2-4: Implement personal trading pre-clearance system; employee training\n- Month 2: Draft and adopt proxy voting policy; begin client disclosure of soft dollars\n- Month 3: Complete business continuity plan; firm-wide compliance training on AMC\n- Ongoing: Annual review and testing of all compliance procedures\n\n**Part C \u2014 Client communication:**\n\nThe firm should communicate its AMC adoption to clients through:\n1. A letter explaining the firm's commitment to the AMC and what it means for clients\n2. Updated disclosures covering proxy voting, soft dollars, valuation methods, and compliance procedures\n3. A commitment to regular reporting on compliance with AMC standards\n4. Offering to answer client questions about the firm's policies and procedures"
