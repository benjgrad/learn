She learns from a corporate board member at a social event that his company will announce a major acquisition next week. The information has not been publicly disclosed. Chen does not trade on the information, but she mentions it casually to her colleague James, who manages a different fund. James subsequently buys shares in the target company. Which statement is most accurate?",

            "A) Chen violated Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information by sharing the information with James, even though she did not trade on it herself",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Standard II(A) prohibits members from acting or causing others to act on material nonpublic information. Chen received MNPI (a pending acquisition is clearly material and nonpublic) and shared it with James, causing him to act on it. The fact that Chen did not personally trade is irrelevant -- by passing the information to James, she enabled (caused) the violation. Both Chen (for sharing) and James (for trading) are in violation. Option B and C misinterpret the scope of the standard, which covers both acting on and causing others to act on MNPI.",

The most recent IPO was significantly oversubscribed and generated a 30% first-day return. The manager allocated 80% of the firm's IPO shares to a large institutional client that generates the highest fees, and 20% among other clients. Which standard is most directly implicated?",

This standard requires that members deal fairly and objectively with all clients when taking investment action. Allocating IPO shares disproportionately to a favored (high-fee) client violates this standard. The firm should have a documented, objective allocation policy (e.g., pro-rata based on account size or suitability). Standard III(A) is also implicated because the manager is not acting in the best interest of the underallocated clients. Option A identifies the right standard but not the full picture.

Park's simultaneous role as a board member of the nonprofit and an employee of the firm seeking to manage its assets creates a clear conflict. He must disclose this relationship to both parties so they can evaluate the conflict. Option A addresses outside compensation, which is not the primary issue here.

Backtested results suffer from look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, and overfitting, and cannot be compared directly to live performance. Kim must clearly disclose that the 10-year track record is simulated/hypothetical and describe the methodology and limitations. Option B ignores the disclosure requirement.

Standard VI(A) requires disclosure of conflicts -- the gift creates a potential conflict between the manager's personal interest (receiving gifts) and her duty to clients (seeking best execution objectively).

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The Asset Manager Code requires firms to implement a risk management process that is functionally separate from portfolio management to ensure objectivity. The process must be ongoing (not periodic), must measure and manage risks at both the portfolio and firm level, and must be appropriate for the complexity of the firm's strategies. This independence is crucial for effective oversight. Option A concentrates risk management with the CIO, undermining independence. Option C is absurd; the goal is managing risk appropriately, not eliminating it (which is impossible and would also eliminate return).",

When the immediate supervisor dismisses a legitimate compliance concern, the member should escalate to the next appropriate level -- typically the compliance department or CCO. The obligation to protect the firm and its clients is not satisfied by a single report to a dismissive supervisor. Option A understates the obligation. Option C (reporting to CFA Institute) may eventually be appropriate but should follow internal escalation first. The member should also document all communications.",

          "question": "A pension fund's board of trustees includes a trustee who is also a senior executive at a real estate firm. The pension fund is considering a $50 million allocation to a real estate fund managed by the trustee's firm. The trustee discloses the relationship and recuses herself from the vote. The remaining trustees approve the allocation. Is this process adequate from an ethical standpoint?",

            "A) Yes, disclosure and recusal are sufficient to manage the conflict",

Best practice requires additional safeguards: an independent due diligence process that evaluates the related party's fund against competitors on objective criteria, documentation of the decision rationale, and enhanced ongoing monitoring. These measures protect the pension fund's beneficiaries and provide evidence that the decision was made on merit.

Clients should understand that returns may be negative.\n\n3. **Standard I(D) Misconduct**: Targeting elderly clients with return guarantees could be considered dishonest conduct that reflects adversely on the professional integrity of the member.\n\nThe personal guarantee also raises regulatory concerns (potential violation of securities laws).
