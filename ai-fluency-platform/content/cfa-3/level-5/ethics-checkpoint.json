          "question": "A portfolio manager receives research from Broker A in exchange for directing 40% of client trades to that broker. Broker A's execution quality is comparable to other brokers. This soft dollar arrangement is:",
          "options": [
            "A) A violation because it directs trades based on research rather than best execution",
            "B) Acceptable if the research benefits the investment decision-making process and is disclosed",
            "C) A violation because all trades must go to the cheapest broker"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Soft dollar arrangements are permitted under CFA Institute Standards if: (1) the research benefits the investment decision-making process, (2) the arrangement is disclosed to clients, and (3) best execution is not compromised. Since Broker A's execution quality is 'comparable to other brokers,' best execution is maintained. The key test is whether clients benefit from the research and are informed of the arrangement. There is no requirement to use the cheapest broker (C) \u2014 best execution considers multiple factors beyond commission cost.",

          "options": [

However, the PM should not simply refuse (C) \u2014 some ESG/social screens may be consistent with fiduciary duty depending on jurisdiction and plan documents. The PM should: (1) evaluate whether the restriction materially harms the portfolio's risk-return profile, (2) consult legal counsel on whether the request is within the plan sponsor's authority, (3) consider whether the IPS allows such restrictions, and (4) document the analysis and decision.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The AMC requires independent valuation \u2014 performed by personnel separate from portfolio management to prevent conflicts of interest. Market prices (A) should be used where available, but many assets (PE, real estate, OTC derivatives) don't have active market prices and require model-based or appraised values. External audits (C) are good practice but not specifically required by the AMC at a quarterly frequency. The independence requirement is the key AMC mandate.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The CITE framework (Cite, Identify, Tell why, Explain correction) is the most effective approach. Examiners award points for: (1) correctly identifying the Standard by number and name, (2) specifically stating what action constitutes the violation, (3) explaining why it violates the Standard, and (4) recommending corrective action.

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard I(A) requires members to report violations through internal channels first. If the compliance officer fails to act, the PM should escalate to senior management, the board of directors, or the firm's legal counsel. If internal escalation is unsuccessful, the PM must dissociate from the activity (refuse to participate) and may need to consider external reporting to regulators. Direct confrontation (A) is not the recommended approach. Immediate external reporting (C) bypasses required internal escalation steps, though it may become necessary if internal channels fail.",

          "explanation": "Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law requires members to comply with the law that is most strict \u2014 whether it's local law, the law of the jurisdiction where the client is domiciled, or CFA Standards. Since both Country B and CFA Standards prohibit front-running, the PM must not engage in front-running regardless of Country A's permissive law. Following the least restrictive law (A) is a violation. While legal opinions (C) can be helpful, the CFA Standards are clear: follow the stricter standard.",
