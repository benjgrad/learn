She manages:\n- A corporate DB pension fund ($2B)\n- Several high-net-worth individual accounts\n- Her own personal retirement account\n\nThe following events occur over a quarter:\n\n**Event 1**: Maria receives a research report from Broker X recommending a buy on PharmaCorp. She has independently researched the stock and agrees. She places orders: first for her personal account (200 shares at 9:01 AM), then for the pension fund (50,000 shares at 9:03 AM), then for individual clients (varying quantities at 9:05 AM).\n\n**Event 2**: The pension fund's plan sponsor (CEO) asks Maria to invest 10% of the fund in the sponsor company's newly issued bonds to help the company raise capital.\n\n**Event 3**: Maria learns that GAM's proprietary trading desk bought PharmaCorp shares yesterday after seeing her research request to the analyst department."

      "solution": "**Event 1 \u2014 Personal trade priority violation:**\n\n**Standard Violated**: Standard VI(B) \u2014 Priority of Transactions\n\n**Violation**: Maria placed her personal trade (200 shares at 9:01 AM) before placing client trades (pension fund at 9:03 AM, individuals at 9:05 AM). Standard VI(B) requires that client transactions take priority over personal transactions.\n\n**Also Violated**: Standard III(B) \u2014 Fair Dealing. Even among clients, the pension fund and individual accounts should have received simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution. The 2-minute gap between the pension fund and individual accounts, combined with the personal trade first, suggests systematic favoritism.\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Maria should place all client orders before any personal trades\n2. Implement a pre-clearance requirement for personal trades\n3. Establish a blackout period for personal trading in securities being traded for clients\n4. Review and revise the firm's personal trading policy\n\n---\n\n**Event 2 \u2014 Plan sponsor conflict:**\n\n**Standard Violated**: Standard III(A) \u2014 Loyalty, Prudence, and Care\n\n**Violation**: The plan sponsor is asking Maria to make an investment decision that benefits the sponsor company (capital raising) rather than the pension fund beneficiaries. Investing 10% in the sponsor's own bonds creates concentration risk and a conflict of interest \u2014 if the company fails, beneficiaries lose both their jobs and a significant portion of their pension.\n\n**Also Violated**: Standard I(B) \u2014 Independence and Objectivity (if Maria complies with the pressure without independent analysis)\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Maria must decline the request if the investment is not in beneficiaries' best interest\n2. Explain to the CEO that fiduciary duty runs to beneficiaries, not the plan sponsor\n3. If the bonds are independently attractive (fair yield, appropriate risk), a small allocation may be acceptable \u2014 but it must be based on investment merit, not sponsor pressure\n4. Document the request and the decision rationale\n5. If the CEO persists, escalate to compliance and legal\n\n---\n\n**Event 3 \u2014 Proprietary trading desk front-running:**\n\n**Standard Violated**: Standard II(A) \u2014 Material Nonpublic Information (potentially)\nAlso: Standard VI(B) \u2014 Priority of Transactions (firm proprietary desk trading before clients)\n\n**Violation**: GAM's proprietary trading desk appears to have front-run Maria's client trades by purchasing PharmaCorp after seeing her research request. This constitutes trading ahead of clients using information about pending client orders.\n\n**Also potentially**: Standard III(A) \u2014 Loyalty, Prudence, and Care \u2014 the firm is putting its own interests ahead of client interests.\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Maria should report the proprietary desk's activity to compliance immediately\n2. The firm must establish or enforce information barriers between the PM function and proprietary trading\n3. The firm should review all proprietary trades that occurred after internal research requests\n4. If front-running is confirmed, the firm may need to compensate affected clients\n5. The firm should implement a restricted list/watch list system to prevent future occurrences\n6. Maria must dissociate from the violation and document her actions"

He discovers:\n\n**Issue A**: The firm has been claiming GIPS compliance, but the large-cap growth composite excludes two underperforming portfolios that the previous CCO deemed \"not representative of the strategy.\"\n\n**Issue B**: A senior PM maintains a blog where he discusses investment themes. Last week, he posted a bullish analysis of a stock he had been accumulating for client portfolios over the prior month. He did not disclose his clients' positions.\n\n**Issue C**: The firm offers a wrap-fee program where financial advisors select from a menu of Summit's strategies. The wrap advisors (not Summit) determine suitability for end clients. Summit's marketing materials state that Summit is responsible for suitability determinations.\n\n**Issue D**: During a compliance review, David finds that two research analysts have been accepting expensive dinners and entertainment from a company they cover. They both rate the stock as a \"Strong Buy.\""

      "solution": "**Issue A \u2014 GIPS composite violation:**\n\n**Standard Violated**: Standard I(C) \u2014 Misrepresentation; also GIPS Standards\n\nClaiming GIPS compliance while excluding underperforming portfolios from composites is a misrepresentation. GIPS requires ALL fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed to a strategy to be included. Excluding underperformers creates survivorship bias and presents a misleadingly favorable track record.\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Immediately include the two excluded portfolios in the composite (retroactively)\n2. Recalculate all composite returns with the corrected data\n3. Reissue corrected GIPS-compliant performance presentations to all prospects who received the incorrect version\n4. If the violation was intentional by the previous CCO, consider regulatory notification\n5. Engage an independent GIPS verifier\n6. Consider whether the firm should temporarily withdraw its GIPS compliance claim until corrections are complete\n\n---\n\n**Issue B \u2014 PM blog activity:**\n\n**Standards Violated**: Standard III(B) \u2014 Fair Dealing; Standard VI(B) \u2014 Priority of Transactions; potentially Standard I(C) \u2014 Misrepresentation\n\nThe PM posted a bullish analysis on a stock he had already accumulated for clients. This raises several issues: (1) Blog readers may trade on the recommendation without knowing clients already hold the position. (2) If the blog post drives up the price, it benefits existing client positions \u2014 effectively, the PM is using public communication to boost client holdings. (3) The non-disclosure of client positions is misleading.\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Require all public communications to disclose the author's and firm's positions in discussed securities\n2. Establish a pre-approval process for public communications by investment professionals\n3. Prohibit discussing specific securities publicly while actively trading them for clients\n4. Review the PM's trading timeline to determine if the blog was used to manipulate the stock price\n\n---\n\n**Issue C \u2014 Suitability misrepresentation:**\n\n**Standard Violated**: Standard I(C) \u2014 Misrepresentation\n\nIf Summit's marketing materials claim responsibility for suitability determinations but the wrap advisors actually perform this function, the marketing materials are misleading. Prospective clients may rely on Summit's claimed suitability oversight when selecting the wrap program.\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Correct marketing materials to accurately describe the division of responsibilities\n2. Clearly state that wrap advisors (not Summit) are responsible for suitability\n3. Consider whether Summit should actually assume suitability oversight, or whether the disclosure is sufficient\n4. Review all existing marketing materials for similar misstatements\n\n---\n\n**Issue D \u2014 Analyst independence:**\n\n**Standard Violated**: Standard I(B) \u2014 Independence and Objectivity\n\nAccepting expensive entertainment from a covered company compromises (or appears to compromise) the analysts' objectivity. The coincidence of a \"Strong Buy\" rating intensifies the appearance of a conflict.\n\n**Corrective Actions**:\n1. Implement or enforce a firm policy on gifts and entertainment with monetary thresholds\n2. Require pre-approval for entertainment from covered companies above a threshold\n3. Review the analysts' research for objectivity \u2014 is the Strong Buy supported by fundamental analysis?\n4. Consider reassigning coverage to analysts without the conflicted relationship\n5. Require disclosure of all gifts and entertainment in a compliance log"
