      "question": "A pension fund reports that its PE allocation has a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, compared to 0.5 for public equities. Should you conclude PE is clearly the superior investment?",
      "answer": "No. The PE Sharpe ratio is likely overstated due to smoothed (appraised) valuations that understate true volatility. PE returns are typically reported quarterly based on appraisals, not market transactions, creating artificially low volatility. Adjusting for smoothing (unsmoothing) typically doubles or triples the standard deviation, which would reduce the Sharpe ratio to 0.4-0.6 \u2014 comparable to public equities. Additionally, PE returns should be compared net of all fees (management fee + carry) and adjusted for leverage."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Alternatives Allocation",
      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Yale Model assessment:**\n\nThe endowment's 45% alternatives allocation is consistent with the \"Yale Model\" (David Swensen's approach). The enabling institutional characteristics:\n\n1. **Perpetual time horizon**: No defined payout date allows tolerance for illiquidity\n2. **Modest spending rate**: 5% annual spending leaves 95% of assets invested long-term\n3. **Governance capacity**: Yale has a dedicated investment office with alternatives expertise\n4. **Size and reputation**: $40B+ attracts access to top-quartile managers (which is critical \u2014 median PE returns may not justify the illiquidity)\n\nRisks of the high allocation:\n1. **Liquidity stress**: In 2008-2009, many endowments faced liquidity crises as capital calls continued while liquid assets declined and spending needs remained\n2. **Manager selection risk**: The wide dispersion of PE returns means below-median manager selection destroys value\n3. **Transparency**: Alternative assets are harder to value, monitor, and risk-manage\n4. **Denominator effect**: When public assets decline, the illiquid allocation percentage rises, potentially breaching policy limits\n\n**Part B \u2014 Smaller endowment constraints:**\n\nA $200M endowment should NOT replicate the Yale Model:\n1. **Access**: Cannot access top-quartile PE/VC managers (high minimums, capacity constraints)\n2. **Diversification**: Cannot diversify across enough vintage years, strategies, and managers\n3. **Governance**: Likely lacks dedicated investment staff for due diligence\n4. **Liquidity**: Smaller spending amounts are a larger percentage of liquid assets\n\nRecommendation: Limit alternatives to 15-20%, primarily through:\n- Diversified fund-of-funds (accepts double fee for diversification and access)\n- Listed alternatives (REITs, infrastructure funds, listed PE) for liquidity\n- One or two co-investment opportunities if governance capacity permits\n\n**Part C \u2014 Risk budgeting adjustment:**\n\nThe reported volatility of the alternatives allocation (8%) is likely smoothed. After desmoothing:\n- True volatility estimate: ~16-20% (2-2.5x reported)\n- True correlation with equities: ~0.6-0.7 (vs. reported 0.3)\n- This changes the risk contribution: alternatives may contribute 35-40% of portfolio risk instead of the reported 15%\n\nThe risk budget should be recalculated using unsmoothed data to ensure the alternatives allocation is not inadvertently concentrating risk."

            "A) PE funds use leverage which amplifies returns",
            "B) Appraisal-based valuations artificially reduce reported volatility",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "PE funds are valued using periodic appraisals (typically quarterly) rather than market transactions. Appraisals tend to smooth out volatility \u2014 they don't fully reflect market movements between valuation dates. This artificially low volatility inflates the Sharpe ratio. The true economic volatility of PE (if marked to market continuously) would be significantly higher, producing a lower Sharpe ratio. Leverage (A) amplifies both return and risk, so it may increase or decrease Sharpe ratio. Skill (C) is debatable and doesn't explain the volatility understatement.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Committing capital across multiple vintage years ensures the PE portfolio is not concentrated in funds that all buy at the same valuation levels (e.g., 2007 vintage PE performed poorly). It also creates a mature portfolio where older funds returning capital offset the J-curve (early negative returns) of newer funds. It does not guarantee positive returns (A) and does not directly affect fee levels (C) \u2014 fees are a function of fund terms, not commitment timing.",
