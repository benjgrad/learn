          "question": "An equity portfolio manager is constructing a portfolio using a stratified sampling approach to track a broad market index with 2,000 constituents. The manager selects 200 stocks by matching the portfolio's sector weights, size distribution, and factor exposures to the index. Which of the following best describes the primary source of tracking error in this approach?",
          "options": [
            "A) The idiosyncratic risk of the 1,800 excluded stocks, which is not fully diversified in the smaller sample",
            "B) Systematic risk differences between the sample portfolio and the index",
            "C) Transaction costs from rebalancing the 200-stock portfolio"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Stratified sampling explicitly matches systematic risk factors (sectors, size, style) between the sample and the index, minimizing systematic tracking error. The primary remaining source is the idiosyncratic risk of individual stocks. With 200 stocks (vs. 2,000), the portfolio retains more firm-specific risk than the full index. While this idiosyncratic risk is partially diversified, it is not fully eliminated and creates tracking error. Option B is minimized by the stratification process. Option C is a drag on returns but not the primary source of tracking deviation.",

Credit spreads will narrow\n2. The yield curve will flatten\n3. Interest rates will decline modestly\n\nWhich combination of positioning relative to the benchmark is most consistent with these views?",

          "explanation": "Alternative investment return data often exhibits smoothing effects from appraisal-based valuations (real estate, PE), infrequent trading (hedge funds), and survivorship/backfill bias. These artifacts produce understated volatility and artificially low correlations with traditional assets. If used directly in optimization, the model will overallocate to alternatives based on overstated risk-adjusted returns.

Manager B's 2% tracking error fits within the budget and delivers a higher information ratio (0.55 vs. 0.45), meaning better alpha per unit of active risk.

The bullet portfolio concentrates holdings around the 7-year maturity, while the barbell holds 2-year and 15-year bonds. Both portfolios have the same present value and duration. Which statement regarding convexity is most accurate?",
          "options": [
            "A) The bullet portfolio has higher convexity than the barbell because its cash flows are concentrated",
            "B) The barbell portfolio has higher convexity than the bullet because its cash flows are more dispersed around the duration point",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Convexity is related to the dispersion of cash flows around the duration point. The barbell's cash flows are spread across 2-year and 15-year maturities, creating greater dispersion and thus higher convexity than the bullet, whose cash flows are concentrated near the 7-year point. Higher convexity means the barbell outperforms the bullet for large parallel shifts in either direction (it falls less when rates rise and gains more when rates fall). However, the bullet outperforms for curve reshaping scenarios like flattening or steepening. Option A reverses the relationship.

The fee differential is 55 - 3 = 52 bps. With an IR of 0.35 and typical tracking errors of 2-4%, the expected gross alpha is roughly 70-140 bps, which appears to exceed 52 bps.

          "explanation": "A sector rotation strategy involves choosing among roughly 10-11 GICS sectors, producing far fewer independent decisions per year than stock selection across hundreds of securities. With low breadth, the fundamental law of active management implies that a given IR requires a higher IC (more skill per decision). More importantly, with few independent decisions, the manager needs a much longer track record to demonstrate statistically significant skill. The standard error of IR is approximately $1/\\sqrt{T}$ for independent annual decisions, but with fewer independent decisions per year, the effective sample size is even smaller. A 5-year track record of a low-breadth strategy provides very weak statistical evidence. Option A is a valid calculation ($IR = 1.2/4.0 = 0.30$) but misses the deeper point.

          "question": "A taxable investor holds a portfolio with a large unrealized capital gain. The investment manager recommends selling the appreciated position and diversifying. From a tax-aware portfolio construction perspective, which factor is most important in evaluating this recommendation?",
          "options": [
            "A) Whether the current position's expected return exceeds the expected return of the diversified alternative",
            "B) Whether the after-tax expected return of the diversified portfolio, reduced by the tax cost of realizing the gain, exceeds the after-tax expected return of continuing to hold the concentrated position",
            "C) Whether the holding period exceeds one year to qualify for long-term capital gains rates"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Tax-aware portfolio construction requires comparing after-tax outcomes, not pre-tax returns. Selling the appreciated position triggers an immediate tax liability that reduces the capital available for reinvestment. This 'tax drag' must be weighed against the diversification benefit. The breakeven analysis asks: does the improvement in risk-adjusted return from diversification exceed the tax cost? Option A ignores taxes entirely. Option C addresses one aspect of the tax treatment but does not capture the full after-tax comparison.",

          "question": "A sovereign wealth fund is constructing its fixed income portfolio and must decide between a pure indexing approach, enhanced indexing, and active management. The fund's investment beliefs include: (1) government bond markets are highly efficient, (2) credit markets offer opportunities for skilled managers to add value, and (3) the fund has limited internal fixed income expertise. Which approach is most consistent with these beliefs?",
          "options": [
            "A) Pure indexing across all fixed income sectors to minimize costs and tracking error",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The fund's beliefs directly map to the recommended approach: (1) Government bond market efficiency suggests indexing (active management is unlikely to add value net of costs). (2) Credit market inefficiency suggests active management can add value. (3) Limited internal expertise suggests using external managers for the active credit mandate. Option B perfectly aligns these beliefs with implementation. Option A forgoes the credit opportunity. Option C contradicts beliefs about government bond efficiency and internal capabilities.",

The trade involves selling 500,000 shares of a mid-cap stock with an average daily volume of 1 million shares. The pre-trade model estimates:\n\n- Expected market impact: 45 bps\n- Estimated timing risk (standard deviation of market impact): 30 bps\n\nIf the manager wants the trade completed within one day, what is the approximate 95% confidence interval for total market impact?",

The wide range reflects the uncertainty inherent in executing a trade that is 50% of the stock's daily volume. Option A assumes the lower bound is zero.

          "explanation": "A completion portfolio's purpose is to offset unintended factor bets created by the combination of active managers, bringing the total fund's factor exposures in line with the policy benchmark. Since the managers collectively overweight growth, the completion portfolio should tilt toward value to neutralize this exposure. The completion portfolio should also minimize other unintended exposures (sector, size, etc.) to avoid introducing new sources of unintended tracking error. Option A amplifies the unintended bet.

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Both attribution frameworks tell a consistent story despite using different decompositions. The Brinson model shows positive allocation effect (+0.30%) and negative selection (-0.15%), indicating sector/allocation decisions add value while stock picking within sectors destroys value. The factor model confirms this: factor timing (+0.10%) and factor exposure (+0.25%) are positive, while security selection alpha (-0.15%) is negative. The manager's skill lies in top-down positioning (sector weights, factor tilts), not bottom-up stock picking.
