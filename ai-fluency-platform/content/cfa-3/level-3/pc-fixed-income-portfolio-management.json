Portfolio modified duration = Liability modified duration\n2. Portfolio present value \u2265 Liability present value (no initial deficit)\n3. Portfolio convexity \u2265 Liability convexity (but minimize excess convexity)\n4. Assumes **parallel yield curve shifts** (single-factor model)\n\n**Why minimize excess convexity?** Higher convexity requires lower yield to achieve the same present value, reducing return. Also, convexity only helps with parallel shifts \u2014 it creates structural risk with non-parallel shifts.\n\n### Contingent Immunization\n\nCombines immunization with **active management**:\n1. If surplus exceeds a threshold, allow active management of the FI portfolio\n2. If surplus approaches zero, revert to full immunization\n3. Provides a **floor return** (immunization rate) with potential for higher returns from active management"

      "question": "An immunized portfolio has duration of 10 matched to a 10-year liability. If the yield curve flattens (short rates rise, long rates fall) rather than shifting in parallel, is the portfolio still immunized?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Classical immunization assumes parallel shifts. If the portfolio is constructed with a barbell (short and long bonds) to match duration of 10, a yield curve flattening would benefit the long bonds and hurt the short bonds. The net effect depends on the portfolio's key rate duration profile. If instead the portfolio uses a bullet (bonds concentrated near the 10-year maturity), it would be much better immunized against non-parallel shifts. This is why immunization for non-parallel shifts requires matching key rate durations, not just overall duration."

Portfolio convexity matches (or slightly exceeds) liability convexity\n3. **Distribution of durations**: Asset durations span the range of liability durations\n4. Regular rebalancing as time passes and rates change\n\n### Key Rate Duration Matching\n\nFor non-parallel yield curve shifts, match **key rate durations** (KRDs) at multiple points:\n- Match 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 30-year KRDs between assets and liabilities\n- More precise than aggregate duration matching\n- Immunizes against twists and butterflies in the yield curve\n\n## Index-Based FI Strategies\n\n| Method | Description | When to Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Full replication** | Hold all index bonds in proportion | Small, liquid indices |\n| **Stratified sampling** | Match key risk factors (duration, sector, credit, callability) | Large indices (Barclays Agg has 10,000+ bonds) |\n| **Enhanced indexing** | Small active bets while tracking index | Low tracking error budget |\n\n### Challenges of Bond Indexing\n- Bonds trade OTC with poor liquidity \u2014 hard to buy all index constituents\n- Index composition changes frequently (new issuance, maturities, calls)\n- Price data may be stale (matrix priced, not traded)\n- Many bonds in the index may be illiquid or unavailable"

      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Immunization strategy:**\n\nTo immunize the pension fund's liabilities (duration 12, convexity 180, PV $800M):\n\n1. **Construct a bond portfolio with**:\n   - Modified duration = 12 years (matching liabilities)\n   - Market value \u2265 $800M (must fund the liability present value)\n   - Convexity \u2265 180 but minimized to reduce structural risk\n\n2. **Prefer a bullet portfolio structure**: Concentrate bond maturities near 12 years rather than using a barbell (2-year + 25-year). The bullet minimizes structural risk from non-parallel yield curve shifts.\n\n3. **Key rate duration matching**: Match KRDs at 5, 10, 15, 20-year points to the liability's key rate duration profile. This immunizes against yield curve twists and butterflies.\n\n4. **Rebalancing protocol**: As time passes and yields change, the portfolio must be rebalanced to maintain the duration match. Set a threshold (e.g., if portfolio duration deviates by >0.5 years from liability duration, rebalance).\n\n**Part B \u2014 Active overlay justification:**\n\nWith the $200M surplus ($1B assets \u2212 $800M liabilities), the fund can pursue contingent immunization:\n\n1. Immunize $800M to secure the liability match (the liability-hedging portfolio)\n2. Manage $200M as a return-seeking portfolio with active strategies:\n   - Duration bets: If CIO expects rates to fall, extend duration modestly\n   - Credit exposure: Add IG and selective HY for spread income\n   - Yield curve positioning: Implement barbell/bullet based on curve view\n\n3. **Trigger**: If the surplus falls below $50M (safety margin), collapse the return-seeking portfolio back into the immunized portfolio. This provides a floor return equal to the immunization rate.\n\n**Part C \u2014 Monitoring and risk:**\n\n1. Monitor dollar duration match monthly; rebalance when deviation exceeds threshold\n2. Stress test against non-parallel shifts (\u00b1100bp steepening/flattening)\n3. Track surplus at risk (SaR) \u2014 the maximum expected surplus decline at 95% confidence\n4. If active strategies lose more than 50% of the surplus cushion, revert to full immunization"
