This is a key insight of the Fundamental Law \u2014 many small, slightly informed bets can produce excellent risk-adjusted performance.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Classical immunization with duration matching is designed to handle parallel shifts. The barbell structure (2-year + 20-year) has duration 10 but is highly sensitive to non-parallel shifts. If the curve flattens (short rates up, long rates down), the losses on 2-year bonds and gains on 20-year bonds will not offset as expected. A bullet portfolio concentrated near 10 years would be much better immunized against non-parallel shifts. Key rate duration matching further addresses this risk.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "When public markets decline (e.g., equities fall 30%), the total portfolio value (denominator) shrinks while illiquid alternatives (which are appraised and slow to mark down) maintain their reported values. The alternatives percentage of the portfolio rises above its policy target. This can force sales of liquid assets to meet spending needs, or worse, force selling of illiquid assets at distressed prices. The 2008 crisis demonstrated this effect dramatically for many endowments.",

          "explanation": "Implementation shortfall measures the total gap between the 'paper' return (if the trade had executed at the decision price) and the actual return, capturing delay costs, market impact, and opportunity costs on unfilled portions. VWAP only measures execution quality relative to the day's volume-weighted average price \u2014 it does not capture delay costs (pre-trade) or opportunity costs (unfilled trades).

          "explanation": "A well-funded, frozen plan has no need for return-seeking assets to close a funding gap (it's overfunded) and no new participants to generate future liabilities. The primary objective is to maintain the funded status and ensure liabilities can be met \u2014 this calls for LDI with long-duration bonds matching liability duration. Adding equity risk (A) is unnecessary and could erode the surplus. Endowment-style allocation (C) is inappropriate because the plan has explicit liabilities and a potentially finite horizon (eventual plan termination).",
