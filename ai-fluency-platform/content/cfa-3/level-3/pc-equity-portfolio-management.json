      "question": "A manager has an active share of 85% and tracking error of 8%. Is this consistent with a fundamental stock-picker or a closet indexer?",
      "answer": "This is consistent with a concentrated fundamental stock-picker. High active share (>60%) indicates significant deviation from the benchmark in holdings. High tracking error (>4%) confirms the portfolio's returns will diverge meaningfully from the index. A closet indexer would have low active share (<30%) and low tracking error (<2%), essentially mimicking the index while charging active fees. The combination of high active share AND high tracking error suggests genuine active management with high conviction positions."

      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Strategy recommendation:**\n\nFor the $5B pension fund's domestic large-cap equity allocation ($2B):\n\nRecommend a **core-satellite approach**:\n- **Core (60-70%, ~$1.3B)**: Passive index fund tracking the broad market (e.g., S&P 500 or total market index). Rationale: Large-cap domestic equities are highly efficient \u2014 generating consistent alpha is difficult, and active management fees erode returns. Low tracking error, low cost.\n\n- **Satellite 1 (15-20%, ~$350M)**: Multi-factor smart beta strategy tilted toward value + quality + momentum. Rationale: Systematic factor exposure at lower cost than fundamental active, with evidence of long-run factor premiums. Diversified factor exposure reduces single-factor timing risk.\n\n- **Satellite 2 (10-15%, ~$250M)**: Concentrated fundamental active manager with high active share (>80%) and demonstrated alpha generation. Rationale: Capacity for a skilled concentrated manager is limited, so a smaller allocation. High active share ensures differentiation from the core passive position.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Evaluation framework:**\n\nMeasure each component against its benchmark:\n- Core: Track S&P 500; evaluate on tracking error (target <0.20%) and cost\n- Smart beta satellite: Track multi-factor index; evaluate on factor exposure consistency and tracking error vs. factor index\n- Active satellite: Evaluate on information ratio (target >0.5), active share maintenance, and style consistency\n\nAggregate evaluation: Total allocation should be measured on risk-adjusted return vs. the policy benchmark (S&P 500), with a total tracking error budget of ~1.5-2.0%.\n\n**Part C \u2014 Rebalancing between core and satellite:**\n\nUse a corridor-based approach:\n- If passive core drifts above 75% (due to satellite underperformance), rebalance back\n- If active satellite exceeds 25% (due to outperformance), take profits and rebalance to core\n- Quarterly monitoring with annual comprehensive review\n- Derivatives overlay (S&P 500 futures) for quick tactical adjustments if needed"
