      "content": "## Issue 1: Asset-Liability Mismatch\n\nThe portfolio duration (3.05 years) is far below the liability duration (13.5 years). This creates enormous surplus risk:\n\n- If rates fall 1%, liabilities increase by ~13.5% ($459M) but assets increase by only ~3.05% on the FI portion ($37M) \u2014 surplus deteriorates by ~$420M\n- The fund is effectively **short duration** \u2014 it benefits from rising rates but is devastated by falling rates\n\n### Recommended Action: Partial LDI Transition\n\n**Phase 1**: Increase long-duration bond allocation from 10% to 25% and shift core FI to long-duration credit\n- New FI allocation: 40% in bonds with average duration ~11\n- New portfolio duration: ~4.4 years \u2014 still below target but a significant improvement\n\n**Phase 2**: Use interest rate swaps to close the remaining duration gap\n- Receive-fixed swaps on $500M notional, swap duration ~12 years\n- Additional portfolio duration: 12 \u00d7 ($500M/$3,000M) = 2.0 years\n- New effective portfolio duration: ~6.4 years\n- Remaining gap: 13.5 \u2212 6.4 = 7.1 years (reduced from 10.45)\n\n**Phase 3**: Over 3-5 years, gradually shift equity allocation toward liability-hedging bonds as funded status improves (glide path)\n\n## Issue 2: Return Generation\n\nTo close the $400M funding gap in 8 years:\n- Required excess return above liability growth: ~$400M / ($3,000M \u00d7 8) \u2248 1.7% per year\n- This requires maintaining meaningful return-seeking allocation (equities, alternatives)\n- **Tension**: LDI transition reduces return-seeking assets \u2192 harder to close the gap\n- **Resolution**: Use derivatives overlay to maintain equity beta exposure while physically holding more bonds"
