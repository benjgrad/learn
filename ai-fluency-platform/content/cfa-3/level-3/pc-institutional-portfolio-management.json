      "question": "An endowment has a 5% spending rule and expects 2% inflation. A board member suggests targeting 7% nominal returns 'to be safe.' Is this sufficient?",
      "answer": "No, 7% is likely insufficient. The required return must cover spending (5%) + inflation (2%) + investment management costs (typically 0.3-0.8%) = approximately 7.3-7.8%. At exactly 7%, the endowment would slowly erode its real purchasing power as costs eat into the margin. Additionally, this is the expected return \u2014 in years where actual returns fall short (and they will), the shortfall compounds. A prudent target would be at least 7.5-8.0% to provide a buffer against below-expected returns and cost drag."

      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Return objective:**\n\nThe corporate DB pension fund (85% funded, $850M assets, $1B PV liabilities) has a dual return objective:\n1. **Liability-matching return**: Earn sufficient return to match liability growth (discount rate used for liabilities, approximately 5-6% for a typical corporate plan)\n2. **Recovery return**: Additional return needed to close the $150M funding gap over 10 years. Required recovery: ($150M / $850M) / 10 \u2248 1.8% per year above liability growth\n3. **Combined target**: ~7-8% nominal return, consistent with a moderate equity allocation (40-50%)\n\n**Part B \u2014 Risk objective:**\n\n1. **Surplus risk**: Maximum acceptable annual surplus volatility of ~8-10% (employer can absorb this level of contribution variability)\n2. **Minimum funding ratio**: Do not fall below 70% funded (regulatory trigger for accelerated contributions)\n3. **Contribution risk**: Limit the probability of required contributions exceeding 10% of sponsor EBITDA to <15%\n\n**Part C \u2014 Constraints and asset allocation:**\n\n**Liquidity**: Annual benefit payments of $60M (7% of assets) \u2014 need sufficient liquid assets\n**Time horizon**: Average duration of liabilities ~12 years; workforce is aging, so duration shortening over time\n**Regulatory**: ERISA fiduciary requirements; prudent expert standard\n**Tax**: Tax-exempt (DB pension fund)\n\n**Recommended allocation:**\n- Liability-hedging portfolio (55%): Long-duration corporate and government bonds, duration-matched to liabilities. Purpose: reduce surplus volatility.\n- Return-seeking portfolio (45%): 25% public equities, 10% alternatives (PE, real estate), 10% credit (HY, EM debt). Purpose: generate returns to close funding gap.\n\n**Rationale for not going 100% LDI**: The fund is underfunded \u2014 pure LDI would lock in the deficit. Some return-seeking assets are needed to close the gap, but this must be balanced against the risk of widening the deficit.\n\n**Part D \u2014 Governance:**\n\n- Investment committee meets quarterly to review funded status, manager performance, and compliance\n- CIO has authority for tactical deviations within \u00b15% of policy weights\n- Annual ALM study by external consultant\n- Contribution policy: Target full funding over 10 years with level contributions"

            "A) Higher allocation to equities and alternatives",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Life insurance companies have explicit long-duration liabilities (contractual obligations) and face risk-based capital (RBC) requirements that impose capital charges for risky assets. This drives them toward investment-grade bonds for duration matching and capital efficiency. Endowments have no explicit liabilities and perpetual horizons, enabling higher equity and alternatives allocations. Despite both having long horizons, their risk tolerance and regulatory constraints differ fundamentally.",

          "options": [

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "A spend-down foundation has a declining effective time horizon. In early years (15-20 years remaining), the horizon is long enough to tolerate equity volatility and earn the equity premium. As the end date approaches, the portfolio should shift to more conservative, liquid investments to ensure remaining distributions can be made with certainty. A perpetual endowment never needs to shift to conservation mode. Option A ignores the early years when a longer horizon exists. Option C ignores the fundamentally different time horizon.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The combination approach is most appropriate. 100% LDI (A) would lock in the 25% deficit with no mechanism to close it \u2014 the sponsor would need to make large cash contributions. 100% equities (C) is reckless \u2014 a market decline could make the fund critically underfunded. The balanced approach hedges a portion of liabilities (reducing surplus volatility) while maintaining return-seeking assets to close the gap.
