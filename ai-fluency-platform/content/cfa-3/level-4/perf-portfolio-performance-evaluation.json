Allocation contributed 0.38%, driven by the beneficial overweight to domestic equities and underweight to fixed income (both decisions enhanced returns in a period where equities outperformed bonds). The interaction effect is negligible.\n\n**Part C \u2014 Risk-adjusted assessment:**\n\nWith tracking error of 3.5%, the information ratio = 1.4% / 3.5% = 0.40. This is a respectable but not exceptional IR. An IR of 0.5+ over a 5-year period would provide stronger evidence of skill. The manager should be monitored for:\n1. Consistency of alpha sources (is selection alpha repeatable?)\n2. Style drift (are the allocation bets intentional or unintentional?)\n3. Risk budget utilization (is 3.5% tracking error within the mandate?)"
