This makes identifying skill from noise extremely difficult."

      "question": "A manager has an information ratio of 0.40 over a 5-year track record. Can you reject the null hypothesis that the manager has zero skill at the 95% confidence level?",
      "answer": "No. The t-statistic = IR \u00d7 \u221an = 0.40 \u00d7 \u221a5 = 0.40 \u00d7 2.24 = 0.89. The critical t-value for 95% confidence (two-tailed) is approximately 2.0. Since 0.89 < 2.0, we cannot reject the null of zero skill. Even though 0.40 is a respectable IR, 5 years is far too short to distinguish skill from luck. We would need (2.0/0.40)^2 = 25 years to reach statistical significance \u2014 a practical impossibility for most manager evaluation cycles."

However, this illustrates the difficulty \u2014 even good managers rarely achieve statistical significance in typical evaluation periods.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Qualitative assessment:**\n\nDespite the statistical ambiguity, qualitative evaluation can differentiate:\n\n**Manager A (Growth equity, 3 years)**: Short track record but strong if:\n- Process is clearly articulated and differentiated\n- Key personnel have longer track records at prior firms\n- AUM is modest relative to strategy capacity\n- Risk: Too early to evaluate; high chance of data mining\n\n**Manager B (Value equity, 8 years)**: Longer record with lower IR:\n- Evaluate whether recent underperformance coincides with value factor headwinds\n- If returns-based style analysis confirms consistent value tilt, underperformance may be cyclical\n- Key question: Has the process changed, or has the market environment changed?\n\n**Manager C (Multi-cap core, 12 years)**: Longest record, moderate IR:\n- 12 years includes multiple market cycles \u2014 strongest evidence of adaptability\n- Holdings-based analysis can reveal whether alpha comes from security selection or factor tilts\n- Most likely to retain: longest record + process consistency across cycles\n\n**Part C \u2014 Recommendation:**\n\nRecommend Manager C for the core allocation based on:\n1. Longest track record spanning multiple cycles (most informative)\n2. Highest t-statistic (1.39) \u2014 closest to significance, though not conclusive\n3. Multi-cap core mandate provides flexibility to allocate across capitalization spectrum\n4. Supplement with Manager A as a satellite allocation if qualitative due diligence confirms strong process and aligned incentives\n\nDecline Manager B if value factor exposure can be achieved more cheaply through smart beta."
