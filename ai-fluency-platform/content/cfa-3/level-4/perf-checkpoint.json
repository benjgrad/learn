          "explanation": "When portfolios will be combined with other assets, the Treynor ratio (excess return per unit of systematic risk) is the appropriate measure, not the Sharpe ratio (which measures total risk). We need the Treynor ratio for each: Treynor = (R_P \u2212 R_f) / \u03b2. Without knowing the actual returns and risk-free rate, we cannot compute Treynor from Sharpe alone (Sharpe uses \u03c3, not \u03b2). The higher Sharpe portfolio (A) might have a lower Treynor if its high total risk comes from diversifiable unsystematic risk.",
