          "question": "A pension fund evaluates its equity manager using time-weighted return (TWR) and money-weighted return (MWR). The manager received a large cash inflow just before the market declined 10%, then recovered 15% in the second half. The TWR is 3.5%, but the MWR is -1.2%. Which statement best explains the discrepancy?",
          "options": [
            "A) The MWR penalizes the manager for poor market timing of cash flows, even though the manager did not control the timing of the inflow",
            "B) The TWR is incorrect because it ignores the impact of cash flows on actual investor experience",
            "C) The MWR is always more appropriate for evaluating manager skill than TWR"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "The MWR (internal rate of return) is influenced by the size and timing of cash flows. The large inflow before the decline meant more capital was exposed to the loss, reducing the MWR. The TWR removes the impact of external cash flows by geometrically linking subperiod returns, providing a cleaner measure of manager skill. In this case, the manager had no control over the cash flow timing, so TWR is the more appropriate measure of investment decision-making ability. Option B is incorrect because TWR is the standard for evaluating managers precisely because it isolates manager decisions from cash flow timing. Option C reverses the standard: TWR is preferred for manager evaluation.",

The firm manages three large-cap growth mandates with slight differences in client restrictions (one client prohibits tobacco stocks, another has a 5% cash minimum). How should the firm handle composite construction?",
          "options": [
            "A) Create a separate composite for each mandate since they have different restrictions",
            "B) Include all three mandates in the same composite if the restrictions do not meaningfully alter the investment strategy, and disclose the restrictions",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "GIPS requires that all fee-paying, discretionary portfolios be included in at least one composite. Minor client restrictions (such as excluding a single sector or maintaining a small cash buffer) do not necessarily make a mandate non-representative of the strategy. If the restrictions do not significantly affect the portfolio's risk/return characteristics or the manager's ability to implement the strategy, the mandates should be included in the same composite. The restrictions should be disclosed. Creating separate composites for minor variations (A) would fragment composites unnecessarily.

            "A) The 60 bps excess return, which demonstrates consistent alpha generation",
            "B) The high key-person risk, because organizational stability is critical for long-term mandates and a key-person departure could fundamentally change the investment process",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "While quantitative metrics (excess return, IR, Sharpe ratio) are important, qualitative factors like organizational stability and key-person risk can dominate the selection decision. A manager with high key-person dependency faces the risk that the departure of a single individual invalidates the entire track record and investment process. For a long-term institutional mandate, this represents a fundamental risk to the expected future performance. The consultant should weigh this heavily, potentially as a disqualifying factor.

However, the historical (pre-acquisition) track record of the non-compliant firm cannot be presented as GIPS-compliant unless it can be verified to meet GIPS standards.

The manager's investment process and team are unchanged, and the underperformance coincides with a period of strong growth stock outperformance. Which recommendation is most appropriate?",
          "options": [
            "A) Terminate the manager immediately because 3 years of underperformance is sufficient evidence of poor skill",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Value managers are expected to underperform during periods of growth stock dominance. The key evaluation question is whether the manager is executing the intended strategy effectively, not whether the style itself is in or out of favor. Since the process and team are unchanged, the underperformance is likely style-driven rather than skill-driven. The manager should be evaluated against a value benchmark (e.g., Russell 1000 Value), not a broad market benchmark. Terminating during style-driven underperformance and switching to the outperforming style (C) is a classic behavioral mistake (performance chasing). Option A applies an arbitrary time threshold without considering the source of underperformance.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "All four risk-adjusted measures are positive, indicating outperformance on a risk-adjusted basis. However, statistical significance is critical for inferring skill. Jensen's alpha has a t-statistic of 1.45, which is below the approximately 2.0 threshold for 5% significance. This means we cannot reject the null hypothesis that alpha equals zero -- the outperformance could be due to chance. Option A ignores the t-statistic. Option C is incorrect because M-squared and alpha measure different things (total risk vs. systematic risk adjustment) and are not expected to give identical values; both being positive is consistent.",

            "A) The manager is misrepresenting the strategy; the committee should immediately terminate the relationship",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The RBSA shows that only 45% of the return variation is attributable to large value, with significant exposure to growth (25%) and small cap (20+30%). For a manager claiming to run a pure large-cap value strategy, this warrants investigation. However, RBSA has limitations: it uses index returns as proxies, is sensitive to the estimation window, and may pick up transient factor exposures. The committee should conduct holdings-based style analysis to verify whether the portfolio actually contains growth or small-cap stocks, or whether the RBSA result reflects statistical artifacts. Option A is premature without further investigation. Option C misinterprets $R^2$; high $R^2$ means the style factors explain total return variation, not that the specific style allocations match the stated mandate.",
