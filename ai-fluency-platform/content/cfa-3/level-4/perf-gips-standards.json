Administered by CFA Institute.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **Fair representation**: Performance must be presented fairly, without cherry-picking\n2. **Full disclosure**: All material information affecting interpretation must be disclosed\n3. **Comparability**: Standardized methodology allows meaningful comparison between firms\n4. **Data integrity**: Performance based on actual portfolios, not hypothetical results\n\n### Who Claims Compliance?\n\n- GIPS compliance is claimed at the **firm level** (not individual composites or funds)\n- The **firm** must be defined as the distinct business entity held out to clients\n- All fee-paying, discretionary portfolios must be included in at least one composite\n- Firms cannot claim partial compliance \u2014 it's all or nothing\n\n## Composite Construction\n\n### Rules\n\n| Rule | Requirement |\n|---|---|\n| **Definition** | All portfolios managed according to the same strategy/objective |\n| **Inclusion** | All fee-paying, discretionary portfolios must be in at least one composite |\n| **Timing** | New portfolios included on a timely and consistent basis (within mandate start) |\n| **Exclusion** | Non-discretionary and non-fee-paying may be excluded (but disclosed) |\n| **Terminated** | Included in composite through the last full measurement period |\n| **No switching** | Portfolios cannot be moved between composites unless documented change in strategy |"

      "answer": "The firm must disclose the number of portfolios or state that the composite contains five or fewer portfolios. When a composite contains five or fewer portfolios, the firm is not required to present a measure of internal dispersion \u2014 it may simply state that the number is too small for meaningful dispersion measurement. However, the firm still must present the 3-year annualized standard deviation of the composite."

The investment decision-makers are the same\n  2. The process/strategy is substantially the same\n  3. The new firm has the records to support the performance\n  4.

      "title": "Constructed Response: GIPS Compliance Assessment",
      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 GIPS violations identified:**\n\n1. **Violation: Selective composite inclusion.** The firm excluded two underperforming portfolios from the large-cap growth composite because they were 'not representative.' GIPS requires ALL fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed to the same strategy to be included. Underperformance is not a valid reason for exclusion.\n\n2. **Violation: Survivorship bias.** A terminated portfolio was removed from the composite history retroactively. GIPS requires terminated portfolios to remain in the composite through the last full measurement period. Historical performance cannot be altered after the fact.\n\n3. **Violation: Insufficient track record presentation.** The firm presents only 3 years of performance for a composite with a 7-year history. GIPS requires a minimum of 5 years (or since inception if shorter), building to 10 years.\n\n4. **Potential issue: Carve-out treatment.** The firm includes the equity portion of balanced portfolios in the equity composite without separately managed cash. Post-2010, carve-outs require their own cash allocation to be included.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Required corrections:**\n\n1. Include all fee-paying, discretionary portfolios in the appropriate composite, including underperformers\n2. Restore terminated portfolio to composite history through its last full period\n3. Present at least 5 years of composite performance (the full 7-year history is available)\n4. Either exclude the carve-outs or manage them with separately allocated cash\n5. Add all required disclosures: fee schedule, composite description, dispersion measure, number of portfolios, firm assets, 3-year standard deviation\n\n**Part C \u2014 Verification recommendation:**\n\nThe firm should engage an independent third-party verifier to:\n1. Verify firm-wide GIPS compliance processes\n2. Perform a performance examination on the large-cap growth composite (given the identified issues)\n3. This provides credibility to prospective clients and forces discipline in the compliance process\n\nVerification is voluntary but strongly recommended, especially for firms seeking institutional mandates."
