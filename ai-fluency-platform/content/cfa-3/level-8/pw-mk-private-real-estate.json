      "question": "A property generates $500K NOI with a cap rate of 5%. Interest rates rise by 100 bps. If the cap rate adjusts fully to 6%, what happens to the property value?",
      "answer": "Original value: $500K / 0.05 = $10M. New value: $500K / 0.06 = $8.33M. Decline: $1.67M or 16.7%. This illustrates the sensitivity of real estate values to cap rate changes. However, cap rates rarely adjust one-for-one with interest rates because: (1) higher rates may coincide with stronger economic growth, boosting NOI expectations; (2) the risk premium component may compress as investors accept lower spreads; (3) real estate markets are slow to reprice due to infrequent transactions. Historical evidence suggests a 100 bps rate increase leads to roughly 25-75 bps cap rate increase, not the full 100 bps."

      "solution": "**A) Current and Stabilized NOI:**\n\nCurrent:\n- Gross potential rent: 200,000 x $42 = $8.4M\n- Vacancy loss: 12% x $8.4M = ($1.008M)\n- Effective gross income: $7.392M\n- Operating expenses: 200,000 x $18 = ($3.6M)\n- NOI: $3.792M\n\nStabilized (market rent, market occupancy):\n- Gross potential rent: 200,000 x $48 = $9.6M\n- Vacancy loss: 8% x $9.6M = ($768K)\n- Effective gross income: $8.832M\n- Operating expenses: $3.6M (assume stable)\n- NOI: $5.232M\n\nNOI upside: $5.232M - $3.792M = $1.44M (38% increase through lease-up and mark-to-market)\n\n**B) Value Estimation:**\n\nCurrent NOI basis: $3.792M / 0.055 = $68.9M\nStabilized NOI basis: $5.232M / 0.055 = $95.1M\n\nThe property should be purchased closer to the current NOI value since stabilization requires execution. A reasonable offer: $72-78M (reflecting some credit for upside but discounting execution risk).\n\nAssume purchase at $75M.\n\n**C) Leveraged Return Analysis:**\n\nDebt: 65% x $75M = $48.75M at 5.5%\nEquity: 35% x $75M = $26.25M\n\nAnnual debt service (30-year amortization): $48.75M x 0.0681 (constant) = $3.32M/year\n(Monthly payment factor for 5.5%/12 over 360 months)\n\nYear 1 (current NOI):\n- NOI: $3.792M\n- Debt service: $3.32M\n- Cash flow to equity: $472K\n- Less cap ex: 200K x $2 = $400K\n- Net cash flow: $72K\n- Cash-on-cash yield: $72K / $26.25M = 0.3% (thin but improving)\n\nYear 3 (stabilized NOI of $5.232M):\n- NOI: $5.232M\n- Debt service: $3.32M\n- Cash flow to equity: $1.912M\n- Less cap ex: $400K\n- Net cash flow: $1.512M\n- Cash-on-cash yield: $1.512M / $26.25M = 5.8%\n\nYear 5 exit at stabilized cap rate of 5.75% (higher terminal cap):\n- Year 6 NOI (3% growth from stabilized): $5.232M x 1.03^2 = $5.55M\n- Exit value: $5.55M / 0.0575 = $96.5M\n- Debt balance at Year 5: ~$45.5M (amortization)\n- Exit equity: $96.5M - $45.5M = $51.0M\n- Equity IRR: Solve for r in -$26.25M + $72K/(1+r) + ... + ($1.51M + $51.0M)/(1+r)^5 \u2248 15-17%\n\n**D) Key Risks:**\n\n1. **Lease-up risk**: Below-market occupancy (88%) may not recover to 92% if remote work reduces office demand. Each 1% vacancy = $96K lost revenue.\n\n2. **Mark-to-market risk**: In-place rents ($42) may not reach market ($48) if leases expire during a downturn. 14% rent increase assumptions may be optimistic.\n\n3. **Interest rate risk**: Floating rate exposure or refinancing risk. A 100 bps rate increase adds $487K to annual debt service.\n\n4. **Obsolescence**: Class A office must maintain amenities, technology, sustainability standards. Deferred capital expenditure could exceed $2/sq ft reserve.\n\n5. **Structural demand shift**: Remote/hybrid work permanently reducing office demand. CBD office may face secular headwinds.\n\n6. **Liquidity risk**: Office assets are increasingly difficult to sell; exit cap rate assumption (5.75%) may be optimistic."
