The GP earns 20% of profits above the 8% preferred return, which on a highly profitable fund can exceed the management fee impact.\n\n3. **Fund expenses:** Organizational, legal, auditing, and other costs further reduce net returns.\n\nFor successful funds (high gross IRR), carried interest is typically the largest fee component.

            "A) Direct lending offers lower yields because the loans are senior and secured",
            "B) Direct lending typically offers a 150-300 bps yield premium over comparable syndicated loans due to an illiquidity premium, smaller borrower size, and the lender's negotiating leverage, while maintaining similar or stronger credit protections through tighter covenants",

            "A) Timberland returns are perfectly correlated with equity markets",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Timberland's unique 'biological growth' feature provides optionality not available in other asset classes:\n\n1. **Growth continues regardless:** Trees grow 5-7% annually in volume regardless of market conditions\n2. **Harvest flexibility:** Unlike crops that must be harvested at maturity, timber harvest can be deferred when prices are low. The trees continue growing, adding value.\n3. **Counter-cyclical harvesting:** The owner can harvest more when prices are high and less when prices are low, effectively buying time\n\nThis optionality reduces downside risk and provides a natural floor on returns.

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The primary risk in private markets portfolio management is a liquidity mismatch: capital calls are contractual obligations (the LP must fund them when called), while distributions are uncertain and tend to decline during market downturns (GPs hold assets longer, delay exits). During a crisis, the worst-case scenario is:\n\n1. Capital calls accelerate as GPs deploy capital into distressed opportunities\n2. Distributions slow as exit markets freeze\n3. The fund's liquidity buffer is depleted\n\nThe pacing model must stress-test for scenarios where calls exceed $80M and distributions fall below $60M.

What bias does appraisal-based valuation introduce into the reported returns?",

This creates artificially low standard deviations in reported returns.\n\n2. **Lagging:** Appraisals reflect past market conditions (the appraiser uses comparable sales that may be months old), creating a lag between actual market movements and reported values.\n\n3. **Low correlation:** The smoothing and lagging effects produce artificially low correlations with publicly traded assets, making real estate appear to be a better diversifier than it truly is.\n\n4. **Serial correlation:** Returns exhibit positive autocorrelation (serial correlation) because each appraisal is influenced by the prior one.\n\nInvestors should 'unsmooth' reported returns (using techniques like the Geltner unsmoothing model) to estimate true economic risk.

The fund must correctly assess the company's asset values, going-concern value, and the priority waterfall in bankruptcy.\n\n2. **Influence over restructuring:** If the fund acquires enough of the senior secured class, it can influence the Plan of Reorganization, potentially steering the outcome (e.g., debt-for-equity swap, asset sales, new capital injection) in a favorable direction.\n\n3. **Timeline:** The duration from purchase (40 cents) to resolution (60-70 cents) determines the IRR. A 3-month timeline with a 50-75% recovery gain would produce an exceptional IRR, but delays reduce returns significantly.\n\nOption A focuses on yield, which is misleading for distressed bonds (the yield assumes the coupon is paid, which is unlikely).
