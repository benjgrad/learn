      "question": "A VC fund has 10 investments. Seven fail completely (0x return), two return 3x, and one returns 50x. What is the overall fund multiple, and what does this tell you about VC portfolio construction?",
      "answer": "Assuming equal investment sizes ($1M each, $10M total invested):\n- 7 failures: $0\n- 2 moderate successes: 2 x $3M = $6M\n- 1 home run: $50M\n\nTotal returned: $56M on $10M invested = 5.6x MOIC.\n\nThis illustrates the 'power law' in VC: a single investment (10% of the portfolio) generated 89% of total returns. The portfolio-level return is excellent despite a 70% failure rate. This is why VCs must: (1) invest in enough companies to increase the probability of catching a winner, (2) size up follow-on investments in winners, (3) not abandon the strategy when early results show mostly failures. It's also why comparing VC to public market returns is misleading -- the distribution of returns is fundamentally different."

      "solution": "**A) Exit Equity Value:**\n\nEBITDA at exit (Year 5): $50M x (1.08)^5 = $73.47M\nExit enterprise value: $73.47M x 10 = $734.7M\nDebt remaining: $300M - (5 x $25M) = $175M\nExit equity value: $734.7M - $175M = $559.7M\n\n**B) Gross MOIC and IRR:**\n\nGross MOIC = $559.7M / $200M = 2.80x\n\nGross IRR: Solve for r in: $200M = $559.7M / (1+r)^5\n(1+r)^5 = 2.80\nr = 2.80^(0.2) - 1 = 22.9%\n\n**C) Net-of-Fees IRR to LPs:**\n\nManagement fees: 2% of $200M committed = $4M/year for 5 years = $20M total\nGross profit: $559.7M - $200M = $359.7M\nProfit net of management fees: $359.7M - $20M = $339.7M\n\nHurdle: 8% on $200M for 5 years = $200M x (1.08^5 - 1) = $93.9M\nProfit above hurdle: $339.7M - $93.9M = $245.8M\nCarried interest: 20% x $245.8M = $49.2M\n\nNet to LPs: $559.7M - $20M (mgmt fee) - $49.2M (carry) = $490.5M\nNet MOIC: $490.5M / $200M = 2.45x\nNet IRR: ($490.5M / $200M)^(1/5) - 1 = 19.7%\n\nFee drag: 22.9% gross - 19.7% net = 3.2% annually\n\n**D) What Could Go Wrong:**\n\n1. **Multiple compression**: If exit multiple drops from 10x to 8x, exit EV = $73.47M x 8 = $587.8M. Exit equity = $587.8M - $175M = $412.8M. MOIC drops to 2.06x, IRR to 15.6%. Multiple compression alone destroys significant value.\n\n2. **Revenue/EBITDA shortfall**: If EBITDA grows at 4% instead of 8%, exit EBITDA = $60.8M. At 10x: EV = $608M, equity = $433M. MOIC = 2.17x.\n\n3. **Refinancing risk**: $300M in debt assumes stable credit markets. If debt needs to be refinanced at higher rates, or covenants are breached, the company could face distress.\n\n4. **FCF below projections**: If free cash flow is only $15M/year (vs $25M), less debt is repaid, and exit equity is lower.\n\n5. **Exit timing**: If the market is unfavorable at year 5, the fund may need to hold longer. Extending to year 7 dramatically reduces IRR even if MOIC is maintained.\n\n6. **Operational risk**: Management execution, competitive dynamics, input cost inflation, regulatory changes."

Specifically: Entry equity = 35% of 8x EBITDA = 2.8x EBITDA. Exit: EV = 8 x 1.3 = 10.4x original EBITDA. Debt = 0.5 x 65% x 8x = 2.6x EBITDA. Exit equity = 10.4x - 2.6x = 7.8x EBITDA.
