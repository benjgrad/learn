      "question": "An LP has committed to 5 PE funds over 5 years, each $20M. In Year 6, the total called capital is $65M, total distributions are $25M, and total NAV is $55M. What is the portfolio's DPI, RVPI, and TVPI?",
      "answer": "DPI = Distributions / Paid-in = $25M / $65M = 0.38x\nRVPI = Residual value / Paid-in = $55M / $65M = 0.85x\nTVPI = DPI + RVPI = 0.38x + 0.85x = 1.23x\n\nThe portfolio is in the mid-life phase: still heavily unrealized (RVPI > DPI), but showing positive total value. The 1.23x TVPI means the portfolio has gained 23% on invested capital, though most of this is unrealized. As a vintage-diversified program, the earlier funds (Years 1-2) are likely more mature with higher DPI, while later funds (Years 4-5) are still in the J-curve. The remaining $35M in uncalled commitments ($100M total - $65M called) represents a future funding obligation."

Typical overcommitment ratio: 1.3-1.8x target allocation.\n\n2. **Denominator effect**: When public markets decline, the private allocation (marked less frequently) appears to grow as a percentage of the portfolio. This may limit new commitments precisely when PE is most attractive.\n\n3. **Cash flow modeling**: Project capital calls and distributions to ensure sufficient liquidity.\n\n$$\\text{Net cash flow}_t = \\text{Distributions}_t - \\text{Capital calls}_t$$\n\nTarget: Net cash flow neutral or positive in steady state.\n\n## Liquidity Management\n\n### Capital Call Lines of Credit\n- Short-term borrowing to smooth capital call timing\n- Bridges between LP liquidity events and GP capital calls\n- **IRR inflation**: By delaying capital calls (borrowing from the line instead), the fund's measured IRR increases (shorter time between cash outflow and inflow for the LP)\n\n### Secondary Market\n- **LP-led secondaries**: Existing investors sell their fund interests to secondary buyers\n- **GP-led secondaries**: GP restructures the fund (continuation vehicles)\n- Pricing: Discount or premium to NAV depending on fund quality and market conditions\n- Growing market: Provides liquidity in an otherwise illiquid asset class\n\n## Cash Flow Modeling\n\nFor a private markets program, model:\n- **Contributions (outflows)**: Capital calls based on commitment size and draw-down schedule\n- **Distributions (inflows)**: Exits based on holding period assumptions and exit multiples\n- **NAV trajectory**: Remaining value based on unrealized investments\n\nTypical draw-down pace: 25-35% of commitment in Year 1, 60-80% cumulative by Year 3.\nDistribution pace: Begins Year 3-4, peaks Year 5-7.\n\n## Performance Benchmarking\n\n### Public Market Equivalent (PME)\n\nCompares PE returns to what the same cash flows would have earned in a public index:\n\n$$\\text{PME} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Distributions} \\times \\text{Index factor}}{\\sum \\text{Contributions} \\times \\text{Index factor}}$$\n\nPME > 1.0: PE outperformed the public market index.\n\n### Direct Alpha\nThe annualized return difference between PE and PME:\n$$\\text{Direct alpha} = \\text{PE IRR} - \\text{PME-derived IRR}$$\n\n### Challenges\n- **Stale NAVs**: Private valuations lag market movements\n- **Survivorship bias**: Failed funds drop out of databases\n- **Selection bias**: Not all GPs report to databases\n- **IRR manipulation**: Capital call lines, subscription facilities inflate IRR"

      "solution": "**A) Commitment Pacing Plan:**\n\nTarget: Increase from $250M (5%) to $750M (15%), a $500M increase in NAV over 5 years.\n\nKey assumptions:\n- Average fund life: 10 years\n- Capital call pace: 30% Year 1, 25% Year 2, 20% Year 3, 15% Year 4, 10% Year 5\n- Distribution pace begins Year 3, accelerates through Year 7\n- Overcommitment ratio: 1.5x (commit $1.50 for every $1.00 of target NAV increase)\n\nTotal new commitments needed: $500M NAV target x 1.5x overcommitment = $750M over 5 years\n\nAnnual commitment plan:\n| Year | New Commitments | Cumulative Committed |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | $175M | $175M |\n| 2 | $175M | $350M |\n| 3 | $150M | $500M |\n| 4 | $125M | $625M |\n| 5 | $125M | $750M |\n\nFront-load slightly in Years 1-2 to build the program faster, then moderate as existing commitments are drawn.\n\n**B) Vintage Year and Strategy Diversification:**\n\nExisting: PE buyout (2 funds), real estate (1 fund). Heavily concentrated in buyout and lacking diversification.\n\nProposed 5-year commitment allocation:\n\n| Strategy | % of New Commitments | Amount | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| PE buyout | 25% | $187.5M | Core allocation, add 2-3 new managers |\n| Growth equity | 10% | $75M | Lower risk than VC, complements buyout |\n| Venture capital | 10% | $75M | High return potential, portfolio diversification |\n| Private credit | 20% | $150M | Current income, lower volatility |\n| Private real estate | 15% | $112.5M | Add to existing; diversify property types |\n| Infrastructure | 15% | $112.5M | Inflation protection, stable cash flows |\n| Natural resources | 5% | $37.5M | Inflation hedge, ESG-aligned (renewables) |\n\nVintage diversification: Commit to 4-6 new funds annually across strategies, ensuring no single vintage year exceeds 25% of total commitments.\n\nManager diversification: Target 15-20 GP relationships across strategies, with no single GP exceeding 10% of total commitments.\n\n**C) Liquidity Requirements:**\n\nCash flow projection ($ millions):\n\n| Year | Capital Calls | Distributions (existing) | Net Cash Flow |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | -$52M (30% of Y1 commit) | +$15M | -$37M |\n| 2 | -$96M (Y1 draw + Y2 draw) | +$25M | -$71M |\n| 3 | -$118M | +$50M | -$68M |\n| 4 | -$105M | +$80M | -$25M |\n| 5 | -$85M | +$110M | +$25M |\n\nPeak cash outflow: Year 2-3 (~$70M annual net outflow)\nSteady state: Year 5+ (cash flow neutral to positive)\n\nLiquidity sources:\n1. Public portfolio rebalancing: Redirect equity/bond profits to fund private markets calls\n2. Capital call credit facility: $50M revolving credit line for timing mismatches\n3. Secondary sales: Option to sell older fund positions if liquidity is needed\n\nLiquidity buffer: Maintain $100M in liquid assets (2% of total portfolio) above normal operating needs to fund unexpected capital calls.\n\n**D) Benchmarking Framework:**\n\n1. **Fund-level**: Compare each fund's IRR, MOIC, DPI to vintage-year peer medians from Cambridge Associates or Preqin benchmarks.\n\n2. **Program-level PME**: Calculate PME against a blended benchmark:\n   - PE: MSCI World + 300 bps (illiquidity premium target)\n   - Private credit: Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index + 200 bps\n   - Real estate: NCREIF Property Index\n   - Infrastructure: CPI + 500 bps (real return target)\n\n3. **Direct alpha calculation**: Annualized excess return over PME for each strategy and overall.\n\n4. **Reporting cadence**: Quarterly NAV updates, annual deep-dive performance review, 3-year rolling PME assessment.\n\n5. **Adjustments**: Flag IRR inflation from subscription credit facilities. Report both 'with facility' and 'without facility' IRRs for each fund."

          "options": [

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Subscription credit facilities (capital call lines) delay capital calls from LPs. Instead of calling LP capital at deal signing, the GP borrows from the credit line and calls LP capital later. This shortens the time LPs' capital is 'at work,' inflating IRR (which is time-sensitive) by 3-7% on average. Option A is misleading -- the facility cost is typically passed to the fund, reducing net return slightly. Option C is actually true (MOIC is unaffected since it measures total dollars, not timing) but misses the key issue that IRR inflation is misleading and is NOT the 'best description.' The correct answer is B because it identifies the mechanism: shortened measurement period artificially boosts the time-weighted return metric.",

          "explanation": "The denominator effect is a well-known problem: when public market values decline (reducing the total portfolio denominator), the private allocation percentage increases mechanically, even though the actual private NAV may also have declined (just not yet reflected in appraisals). Many pension fund policies require pausing new commitments when the allocation exceeds the target band. This is problematic because recession-period vintages historically produce the best PE returns. Option A is what rational investors should do but institutional constraints prevent it. Option C is possible but counterproductive (selling in a down market). The denominator effect is a significant impediment to optimal private markets investing.",
