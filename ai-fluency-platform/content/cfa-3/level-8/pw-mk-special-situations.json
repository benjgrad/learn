Convert debt to equity, becoming the new owner. Works when the business is viable but overleveraged.\n\n**Par recovery/Trading**: Buy debt at deep discount when market panic exceeds actual credit risk. Hold for recovery toward par as the market normalizes.\n\n**DIP financing**: Provide debtor-in-possession financing during bankruptcy. Super-senior priority provides downside protection; fees and warrants provide upside."

      "question": "A company's capital structure has $200M in senior secured debt, $150M in senior unsecured debt, and $100M in subordinated debt. The company is being liquidated with asset proceeds of $280M. What does each class of creditor recover?",
      "answer": "Under the absolute priority rule, creditors are paid in order of seniority:\n\n1. Senior secured: $200M claim, receives full $200M (100% recovery)\n2. Remaining proceeds: $280M - $200M = $80M\n3. Senior unsecured: $150M claim, receives $80M (53.3% recovery)\n4. Subordinated: $100M claim, receives $0 (0% recovery)\n5. Equity: $0\n\nThis waterfall analysis is critical for distressed investing. A distressed investor buying senior unsecured at 40 cents ($60M cost for $150M face) would receive $80M -- a 33% return on investment. Buying subordinated at even 5 cents ($5M cost for $100M face) would yield zero. Understanding where the 'fulcrum security' falls (the security that converts from debt to equity in restructuring) is the key to distressed debt investing. Here, senior unsecured is the fulcrum."

      "content": "## Turnaround Investing\n\nInvesting in operationally distressed companies with potential for recovery:\n\n- **Operational turnaround**: New management, cost restructuring, asset divestitures\n- **Financial turnaround**: Debt restructuring, new capital injection, covenant amendments\n- **Strategic turnaround**: New business direction, market repositioning\n\nKey success factors:\n- Quality of underlying business (good company, bad balance sheet)\n- New management capability\n- Industry dynamics (secular decline vs cyclical trough)\n- Time and capital requirements\n\n## Capital Structure Arbitrage\n\nExploit mispricings between different securities of the same company:\n\n- **Long debt / Short equity**: When equity is overvalued relative to credit risk\n- **Long senior / Short subordinated**: When spread differential doesn't reflect seniority difference\n- **Long CDS / Short equity**: When CDS protection is cheap relative to equity decline risk\n\n## Convertible Arbitrage\n\n$$\\text{Convertible bond value} = \\text{Bond floor} + \\text{Equity option value}$$\n\nStrategy: Buy convertible bond, short the underlying stock by the **delta** amount.\n\nProfit sources:\n- **Gamma trading**: Rebalancing the hedge as the stock moves captures convexity value\n- **Carry**: Coupon income exceeds short rebate cost\n- **Volatility**: Long implied vol (via the option) vs short realized vol\n\n## The Bankruptcy Process\n\n### Chapter 11 (Reorganization)\n1. Company files petition; automatic stay protects from creditors\n2. Debtor proposes plan of reorganization\n3. Creditor committees negotiate plan terms\n4. Court confirms plan; debt is restructured\n5. Company emerges with new capital structure\n\n### Chapter 7 (Liquidation)\n1. Trustee appointed to liquidate assets\n2. Proceeds distributed per absolute priority rule\n3. Company ceases to exist\n\n### Credit Bid\nA secured creditor can 'bid' their debt claim for assets in a 363 sale, effectively acquiring assets without cash. This is powerful when the debt was purchased at a discount."

      "solution": "**A) Waterfall Analysis:**\n\n**Liquidation Scenario ($450M):**\n| Tranche | Claim | Recovery | Recovery % | Market Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Senior secured | $400M | $400M | 100% | 85 cents |\n| Senior unsecured | $300M | $50M | 16.7% | 45 cents |\n| Subordinated | $200M | $0 | 0% | 8 cents |\n| Equity | Residual | $0 | 0% | $0.50 |\n\n**Going-Concern Scenario ($600M):**\n| Tranche | Claim | Recovery | Recovery % | Market Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Senior secured | $400M | $400M | 100% | 85 cents |\n| Senior unsecured | $300M | $200M | 66.7% | 45 cents |\n| Subordinated | $200M | $0 | 0% | 8 cents |\n| Equity | Residual | $0 | 0% | $0.50 |\n\nNote: Even in the going-concern scenario, there is no recovery for subordinated debt or equity ($600M < $400M + $300M = $700M senior claims).\n\n**B) Fulcrum Security:**\n\nThe fulcrum security is the **senior unsecured notes**. This is the class where value breaks -- senior secured is fully covered in both scenarios, while subordinated has zero recovery in both. The senior unsecured notes will likely convert to equity in the reorganized company.\n\nIn the going-concern scenario, senior unsecured receives $200M of the $300M claim (66.7%). In a typical restructuring, this $200M would be converted to equity ownership, potentially giving senior unsecured holders approximately 100% of the reorganized company's equity (since subordinated and old equity are wiped out).\n\n**C) Recommended Strategy: Buy Senior Unsecured Notes**\n\nTarget: Accumulate a significant position in senior unsecured notes at 45 cents.\n\nRationale:\n- At 45 cents, you pay $135M for $300M in claims (assuming you buy the entire tranche)\n- Going-concern recovery: $200M in value (48% return on $135M investment)\n- If the restructured equity is worth $200M+ and senior unsecured holders receive 100% of it, the upside is substantial\n- As the fulcrum security, this position gives maximum influence in the restructuring process\n- Control of the restructuring allows you to shape the outcome (management selection, capital structure, strategy)\n\nAlternative: Buy senior secured at 85 cents for a safer position. Recovery is 100% under both scenarios, but upside is limited to 15 cents (18% return). Lower risk, lower return.\n\nAvoid: Subordinated (8 cents) and equity ($0.50) -- both have zero recovery under all realistic scenarios. The market is pricing in a lottery ticket that doesn't exist.\n\n**D) Risk-Return Assessment:**\n\n| Position | Cost | Liquidation Return | Going-Concern Return | Risk Level |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Senior secured (85c) | $340M | +18% ($400M/$340M) | +18% | Low |\n| Senior unsecured (45c) | $135M | -63% ($50M/$135M) | +48% ($200M/$135M) | High |\n| Subordinated (8c) | $16M | -100% | -100% | Very high |\n| Equity ($0.50) | $50M | -100% | -100% | Very high |\n\nThe senior unsecured position has the most asymmetric risk-return profile: lose 63% in liquidation but gain 48% (or more if going-concern value exceeds $600M) in reorganization. The key question is: Is this a viable business that should reorganize (going-concern) or should it be liquidated?\n\nIf the business has strong store locations, loyal customers, and the issues are primarily financial (too much debt from a prior LBO), the going-concern scenario is likely and senior unsecured is the optimal trade. If the business faces secular decline (e-commerce disruption, shifting consumer preferences), liquidation is more likely and senior secured is the safer choice."

          "explanation": "The absolute priority rule (APR) establishes the payment waterfall: secured creditors first, then unsecured creditors, then subordinated creditors, then equity holders. Each class must be paid in full before the next class receives anything. In practice, deviations from strict APR sometimes occur through negotiation (e.g., equity holders may receive a small allocation to avoid litigation that delays the process). Option A describes the equal treatment principle (within a class, creditors are treated equally), not the APR. Option C describes the exclusivity period, not the APR.",

Since the bond trades above conversion value, you wouldn't convert (you'd lose the $70 premium). The bond is 'out-of-the-money' relative to par: conversion value ($750) < par ($1,000). The $820 price reflects the bond floor (present value of coupon + principal) plus a small equity option value. Option A is incorrect -- the bond is out-of-the-money (conversion value below par).

          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "DIP financing has super-senior priority: $20M + interest. Assume 1 year in bankruptcy: DIP repayment = $20M x 1.12 = $22.4M.\n\nRemaining value: $60M - $22.4M = $37.6M for senior secured claims.\nSenior secured claim: $50M face. Recovery: $37.6M (75.2 cents on the dollar).\n\nTotal cash received: $22.4M (DIP) + $37.6M (senior secured) = $60M\nTotal invested: $35M (debt purchase) + $20M (DIP) = $55M\nReturn: ($60M - $55M) / $55M = 9.1%\n\nWait -- let me recalculate. The DIP is repaid first at $22.4M. The remaining $37.6M goes to senior secured ($50M claim). So the investor receives $22.4M + $37.6M = $60M total on $55M invested = 9.1% return. This is actually closest to option A. However, if there were additional senior secured creditors sharing the $37.6M, the investor would receive less. If the investor holds ALL the senior secured debt, they receive the full $37.6M. The answer is A at approximately 9%. But including the DIP interest ($2.4M), the total recovery is better analyzed as: DIP return = 12% on $20M. Debt purchase return = ($37.6M - $35M) / $35M = 7.4%. Blended: approximately 9% on total capital. Closest to A.",
