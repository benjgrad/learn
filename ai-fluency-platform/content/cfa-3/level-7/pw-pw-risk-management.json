      "question": "A wealthy client with $20M in assets and no dependents asks whether she needs life insurance. What is the best reason she might still want it?",
      "answer": "Estate liquidity. Even without dependents, a $20M estate may face significant estate taxes (potentially $3-5M depending on exemptions). If the estate consists largely of illiquid assets (real estate, business interests), there may not be sufficient liquid assets to pay estate taxes within the 9-month filing deadline. Life insurance (especially an irrevocable life insurance trust, ILIT) provides tax-free liquidity to pay estate taxes without forcing the sale of illiquid assets at fire-sale prices. The ILIT also keeps the insurance proceeds outside the taxable estate. Other reasons: charitable legacy planning, equalization among heirs (one gets the business, others get insurance proceeds)."

Reasons:\n- **Loss of control**: Cannot access principal after annuitization\n- **Bequest motive**: Nothing left for heirs if annuitant dies early\n- **Behavioral factors**: Loss aversion, framing as a gamble\n- **Existing annuitization**: Social Security and pensions already provide annuity-like income\n\n## Disability and Long-Term Care Insurance\n\n### Disability Insurance\n- Replaces income if unable to work\n- **Own-occupation vs any-occupation**: Own-occ pays if you can't do your specific job\n- Typically covers 60-70% of income (to maintain incentive to return to work)\n- Elimination period: 90-180 days before benefits begin\n\n### Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance\n- Covers custodial care (nursing home, assisted living, home care)\n- Trigger: Inability to perform 2+ activities of daily living (ADLs)\n- Can be very expensive, especially purchased after age 60\n- Hybrid products: Life insurance with LTC rider (provides both benefits)\n\n## Insurance Needs Analysis\n\n**Human life value approach:**\n$$\\text{Insurance need} = PV \\text{ of future earnings} - PV \\text{ of personal consumption}$$\n\n**Needs analysis approach:**\n$$\\text{Insurance need} = PV \\text{ of obligations (mortgage, education, income replacement)} - \\text{Existing resources}$$"

      "title": "Constructed Response: Risk Management Plan\n\nClient: Thomas and Linda Park, ages 48 and 46.\n- Combined income: $500K (Thomas $350K surgeon, Linda $150K attorney)\n- Net worth: $4M (home $1.2M with $400K mortgage, investments $2.5M, other $300K)\n- Three children: ages 8, 12, 16\n- Thomas has employer group life ($700K) and group disability (60% of base)\n- Linda has no employer insurance\n- Neither has long-term care insurance\n\nA) Identify the three most critical risks for this family.\nB) Calculate the life insurance need for Thomas.\nC) Evaluate whether their disability coverage is adequate.\nD) Recommend an overall risk management plan.",
      "solution": "**A) Three Most Critical Risks:**\n\n1. **Thomas's mortality/disability risk**: As the higher earner ($350K), his death or disability would eliminate 70% of family income. Current group life ($700K) replaces only 2 years of his income -- grossly inadequate for a family with children aged 8-16.\n\n2. **Linda's lack of any insurance**: No life or disability coverage. If Linda dies or becomes disabled, the family loses $150K annually and must fund childcare/household support. Her income also funds retirement savings.\n\n3. **Longevity and healthcare risk** (future): As a surgeon, Thomas has high income but demanding physical requirements. Disability before retirement would be devastating. Neither has LTC coverage for eventual needs.\n\n**B) Life Insurance Need for Thomas (Needs Analysis):**\n\nIncome replacement: $350K/year for 20 years (until youngest child is independent)\n- PV at 4% discount: $350K x annuity factor (20, 4%) = $350K x 13.59 = $4.76M\n\nMortgage payoff: $400K\nChildren's education: 3 children x $200K each = $600K (PV)\nEmergency fund: $200K\nFinal expenses: $50K\n\nTotal needs: $6.01M\nLess existing resources:\n- Group life: $700K\n- Investments: $2.5M (but these fund retirement -- should not be fully depleted)\n- Social Security survivor benefits: ~$3K/month for 10 years = $360K PV\n\nInsurance gap: $6.01M - $700K - $1.0M (portion of investments) - $360K = $3.95M\n\nRecommendation: $4M in term life insurance (20-year level term to cover children's dependency period)\n\n**C) Disability Coverage Evaluation:**\n\nThomas:\n- Group disability: 60% of base salary. If base is $250K (with $100K in bonuses/surgical fees), coverage = $150K/year\n- Gap: $350K - $150K = $200K shortfall\n- Group disability is likely 'any occupation' (weaker protection for a surgeon)\n- Need: Individual own-occupation disability policy for $100-150K additional annual coverage\n\nLinda:\n- Zero disability coverage -- critical gap\n- Need: Individual disability policy covering ~$100K/year (67% of income)\n\n**D) Comprehensive Risk Management Plan:**\n\n1. **Thomas**: Purchase $4M 20-year level term life + $150K/year individual own-occupation disability policy. Estimated annual cost: Life ~$3,500 + Disability ~$6,000 = $9,500\n\n2. **Linda**: Purchase $2M 20-year level term life + $100K/year individual disability policy. Estimated annual cost: Life ~$1,500 + Disability ~$3,500 = $5,000\n\n3. **Umbrella liability**: $3-5M umbrella policy given surgeon malpractice exposure and net worth. Cost: ~$500-800/year\n\n4. **Long-term care**: Defer purchase until ages 55-60 when pricing is more favorable but still insurable. Consider hybrid life/LTC products at that time. Currently: Self-insure given age and health.\n\n5. **Review schedule**: Annual insurance review; adjust coverage as children become independent, mortgage is paid, and wealth grows. As financial capital replaces human capital, reduce term life coverage.\n\nTotal annual insurance cost: ~$15,000-16,000 (3% of income -- well within guidelines of 5-8%)"

With Social Security ($40K) + annuity ($85K) = $125K, her essential spending ($120K) is fully covered for life, eliminating the risk of running out of money. Option A is misleading -- annuity 'returns' include mortality credits (payments from those who die early fund those who live long), not traditional investment returns. Option C is incorrect -- annuity payments include a taxable portion (the return of investment is excluded, but the earnings component is taxed).",
