      "content": "## Goals-Based Investing Framework\n\nTraditional wealth management optimizes a single portfolio for risk and return. Goals-based investing creates **sub-portfolios aligned with specific goals**, each with its own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n### Why Goals-Based Works\n\n1. **Aligns with mental accounting**: People naturally think in terms of goals, not portfolio statistics\n2. **Customized risk per goal**: Essential goals get conservative allocation; aspirational goals can take more risk\n3. **Behavioral benefits**: Clients tolerate market volatility better when they see essential goals protected\n4. **Clearer communication**: Progress measured against goals, not benchmarks\n\n### Goal Classification\n\n| Priority | Description | Required Probability | Typical Allocation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Essential | Must fund (basic retirement, housing) | 85-95% | Conservative |\n| Important | Should fund (education, travel) | 70-80% | Moderate |\n| Aspirational | Nice to fund (legacy, luxury) | 50-70% | Aggressive |\n\n## Probability-Weighted Expected Outcomes\n\nFor each goal, calculate the probability of achieving the required amount:\n\n$$P(\\text{Goal met}) = P(W_T \\geq G)$$\n\nWhere $W_T$ = portfolio value at horizon $T$, $G$ = goal amount.\n\nUsing a normal distribution approximation:\n\n$$P(\\text{Goal met}) \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{E(W_T) - G}{\\sigma(W_T)}\\right)$$\n\nThe advisor selects an allocation that achieves the required probability for each goal."

      "question": "A client's essential retirement goal requires $3M in 15 years with 90% probability. Current assets allocated to this goal: $1.5M. Using a moderate allocation (expected return 6%, volatility 10%), can this goal be met?",
      "answer": "Expected value in 15 years: $1.5M x (1.06)^15 = $3.59M. This exceeds the $3M target, but we need 90% probability, not just expected value. The standard deviation of the terminal value (simplified): $3.59M x 10% x sqrt(15) = $3.59M x 38.7% = $1.39M. For 90% probability: $3.59M - 1.28 x $1.39M = $3.59M - $1.78M = $1.81M. This is below $3M, meaning there is NOT a 90% probability of meeting the goal with a moderate allocation. Options: (1) increase current allocation (more capital), (2) reduce the goal, (3) extend the time horizon, or (4) accept a lower probability. A more conservative allocation with lower volatility might actually achieve 90% probability despite lower expected return, because the downside tail is narrower."

The aggregate expected return of ~5.8% and volatility of ~8.5% is reasonable for her situation. No unintended concentrations. The goals-based approach achieved a moderate aggregate while protecting essential goals with conservative allocations."
