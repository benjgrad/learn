If initial investment equals cost basis, $B = 1$.\n\n### Accrual Equivalent Tax Rate\n\nThe $T_{AE}$ that makes annual taxation equivalent to the actual after-tax accumulation:\n\n$$[1 + r(1 - T_{AE})]^n = FV_{\\text{actual after-tax}}$$\n\nKey insight: **Tax deferral always reduces the effective tax rate below the statutory rate**. Longer deferral = lower $T_{AE}$.\n\n### Example\n\nInvestor with $100, 8% return, 30% tax rate, 20-year horizon:\n- Annual taxation: $100 x [1 + 0.08(1-0.30)]^20 = $100 x (1.056)^20 = $297.20\n- Deferred taxation: $100 x [(1.08)^20(1-0.30) + 0.30] = $100 x [4.661 x 0.70 + 0.30] = $356.27\n\nDeferral advantage: **$59.07** or nearly 20% more wealth."

      "question": "An investor can choose between: (A) a tax-exempt municipal bond yielding 3.5%, or (B) a taxable corporate bond yielding 5.0%. Her marginal tax rate is 35%. Which is better on an after-tax basis?",
      "answer": "The taxable bond is better. After-tax yield on the corporate bond: 5.0% x (1 - 0.35) = 3.25%. Wait -- that's actually less than the muni's 3.5%. The tax-exempt muni is better. The breakeven tax rate is: 1 - (3.5/5.0) = 30%. Since her tax rate (35%) exceeds the breakeven (30%), the muni provides higher after-tax income. However, this simple comparison assumes equal credit risk, equal state tax treatment, and doesn't account for the muni's potential AMT implications. In practice, also compare total return (price appreciation potential) and liquidity."

Sell losing position\n2. Immediately reinvest in a similar (not identical) investment\n3. Offset realized gains; excess losses carry forward\n4. **Wash sale rule**: Cannot repurchase substantially identical security within 30 days\n\nValue of harvesting: PV of tax deferral on the gains offset.\n\n## Charitable Giving Strategies\n\n- **Donate appreciated securities**: Avoid capital gains tax + get full fair market value deduction\n- **Donor-advised fund (DAF)**: Immediate deduction, distribute to charities over time\n- **Charitable remainder trust (CRT)**: Income stream to donor, remainder to charity\n- **Charitable lead trust (CLT)**: Income to charity, remainder to heirs (reduces estate)\n- **Qualified charitable distribution (QCD)**: Donate directly from IRA (age 70.5+), counts toward RMD"

      "title": "Constructed Response: Tax-Efficient Portfolio Design\n\nClient: Margaret Williams, age 58, recently widowed.\n- Taxable account: $2.5M (60% stocks, 40% bonds)\n- 401(k): $1.2M (100% target date fund)\n- Roth IRA: $400K (index funds)\n- Inherited IRA from spouse: $800K (must take RMDs over 10 years)\n- Annual income: $180K from part-time consulting; will retire fully at 63\n- Marginal tax rate: 32% (federal) + 5% (state) = 37%\n- Charitable intent: Donates $30K annually to her university\n\nA) Recommend an asset location strategy across her four accounts.\nB) Design a tax-loss harvesting approach for her taxable account.\nC) Optimize her charitable giving strategy.\nD) Calculate the benefit of Roth conversion of $100K from the 401(k) this year.",
      "solution": "**A) Asset Location Strategy:**\n\nTotal portfolio: $4.9M. Target allocation: 55% equity, 35% bonds, 10% alternatives/REIT\n\nOptimal location:\n- **Taxable ($2.5M)**: Index equity funds ($1.7M -- low turnover, qualified dividends taxed at preferential rates), tax-exempt municipal bonds ($600K -- tax-free income at her 37% combined rate), individual stocks ($200K -- control over gain realization)\n- **401(k) ($1.2M)**: Taxable bonds ($700K -- interest taxed at ordinary rates upon withdrawal anyway), REITs ($300K -- REIT dividends are ordinary income), TIPS ($200K -- phantom income problem solved in tax-deferred)\n- **Roth IRA ($400K)**: Highest-growth investments -- small-cap equity ($200K), emerging markets ($200K). These benefit most from permanent tax exemption\n- **Inherited IRA ($800K)**: Balanced mix ($500K bonds, $300K equity). Must be distributed within 10 years -- plan distributions to minimize total tax over the 10-year window\n\n**B) Tax-Loss Harvesting Approach:**\n\nReview the taxable account's stock holdings for unrealized losses:\n1. Identify positions with >5% unrealized losses\n2. Sell losing positions and replace with similar (not identical) investments (e.g., sell S&P 500 ETF, buy total market ETF)\n3. Use harvested losses to offset any realized gains from rebalancing\n4. Carry forward excess losses ($3K annual deduction against ordinary income; remainder carries forward)\n5. Systematically harvest before year-end, being mindful of wash sale rules\n6. Estimate: If 15% of stock portfolio has unrealized losses averaging 15%, potential harvest = $2.5M x 0.60 x 0.15 x 0.15 = $33.75K in losses, saving $33.75K x 23.8% (LTCG + NIIT) = $8K in current-year taxes\n\n**C) Charitable Giving Optimization:**\n\nCurrent approach ($30K cash donation): Deduction = $30K x 37% = $11,100 tax savings\n\nOptimal approach:\n1. Donate $30K of appreciated stock from the taxable account instead of cash\n   - Avoids capital gains tax on appreciation (assume $20K basis): Saves $10K x 23.8% = $2,380 in capital gains tax\n   - Still gets full $30K deduction: $11,100 tax savings\n   - Total benefit: $13,480 vs $11,100 with cash = $2,380 additional savings annually\n\n2. Open a Donor-Advised Fund: Bunch 2-3 years of giving ($60-90K) into one year to exceed standard deduction threshold, then distribute over time. This is especially valuable if she itemizes marginally.\n\n3. At age 70.5+: Use QCDs from the inherited IRA to satisfy RMDs while directing to charity. This removes the income from AGI entirely (better than a deduction).\n\n**D) Roth Conversion Analysis:**\n\nConvert $100K from 401(k) to Roth IRA this year:\n- Tax cost now: $100K x 37% = $37,000 (paid from non-retirement assets)\n- Future benefit: $100K growing tax-free in Roth for 25+ years\n\nAssume 7% growth, 25-year horizon:\n- In Roth: $100K x (1.07)^25 = $542,743 (entirely tax-free)\n- In 401(k): $100K x (1.07)^25 = $542,743, but taxed at withdrawal. If future rate is 32%: $542,743 x (1-0.32) = $369,065\n\nBenefit: $542,743 - $369,065 = $173,678 more after-tax\nNet of conversion cost ($37,000): Net benefit = $173,678 - $37,000 = $136,678\n\nConversion is beneficial IF: (1) she pays the tax from non-retirement funds, (2) her future tax rate is similar or higher, (3) she has a long enough horizon. At age 58 with 25+ years, this is a strong Roth conversion candidate. Consider converting $50-100K annually during the 5 years before Social Security starts (potentially lower bracket)."
