      "title": "**Scenario 1: Asset Allocation for a University Endowment**\n\nThe Hartfield University Endowment has $800 million in assets and a 5% annual spending rate. The endowment receives approximately $10 million annually in new gifts. Expected inflation is 2.5%. The endowment has no debt and is tax-exempt. The current allocation is:\n\n| Asset Class | Current Allocation | Expected Return | Volatility |\n|-------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|\n| US Equity | 35% | 8.5% | 16% |\n| International Equity | 20% | 9.0% | 18% |\n| Fixed Income | 30% | 4.0% | 5% |\n| Alternatives | 15% | 10.0% | 14% |\n\nThe investment committee is concerned about: (a) maintaining purchasing power, (b) the adequacy of the current allocation to meet spending needs, and (c) the potential impact of a prolonged low-interest-rate environment on the fixed income allocation.\n\n**Part A (4 points):** Calculate the endowment's minimum required nominal return, accounting for spending, inflation, and investment management costs (assume 0.4% in costs). Does the current allocation meet this requirement based on the weighted-average expected return?\n\n**Part B (4 points):** The committee is debating whether to reduce fixed income from 30% to 15% and increase alternatives from 15% to 30%. Evaluate this proposal, addressing both the potential benefits and risks.\n\n**Part C (4 points):** Recommend a rebalancing policy for the endowment, specifying: (1) the approach (calendar, percentage-of-portfolio, or combination), (2) tolerance bands, and (3) how illiquid alternatives should be handled within the rebalancing framework.",
      "solution": "**Part A: Required Return Calculation**\n\nThe minimum required nominal return must cover spending, inflation, and costs:\n\n$$r_{min} = (1 + \\text{spending})(1 + \\text{inflation})(1 + \\text{costs}) - 1$$\n$$= (1.05)(1.025)(1.004) - 1 = 1.0808 - 1 = 8.08\\%$$\n\nNote: The $10 million in annual gifts partially offsets the spending requirement. Effective spending rate = ($40M spending - $10M gifts) / $800M = 3.75%. Using the effective rate:\n$$r_{min} = (1.0375)(1.025)(1.004) - 1 = 6.83\\%$$\n\nWeighted-average expected return of current allocation:\n$$E(R) = 0.35(8.5\\%) + 0.20(9.0\\%) + 0.30(4.0\\%) + 0.15(10.0\\%)$$\n$$= 2.975\\% + 1.80\\% + 1.20\\% + 1.50\\% = 7.475\\%$$\n\nThe current allocation's expected return (7.475%) exceeds the gift-adjusted minimum (6.83%) but falls below the unadjusted minimum (8.08%). The endowment should not rely on gifts to meet its return requirement, as gift flows are uncertain. **The current allocation is marginally adequate but has limited cushion.**\n\n**Part B: Evaluation of Proposed Allocation Change**\n\n**Benefits:**\n1. Higher expected return: Replacing 15% fixed income ($4.0\\%$) with alternatives ($10.0\\%$) adds approximately $0.15 \\times (10.0\\% - 4.0\\%) = 0.90\\%$ to the portfolio's expected return, improving the probability of meeting the spending requirement.\n2. Improved diversification: Alternatives may have lower correlations with traditional assets, potentially improving the Sharpe ratio.\n3. Inflation protection: Many alternatives (real estate, infrastructure, commodities) provide natural inflation hedging.\n\n**Risks:**\n1. Liquidity reduction: Increasing alternatives from 15% to 30% locks up a larger portion of the portfolio. With 55% in equities and 30% in alternatives, only 15% is in liquid fixed income, which may be insufficient to fund the 5% annual distribution plus rebalancing needs.\n2. Transparency and valuation: Alternatives are subject to appraisal-based valuations that understate true risk. The committee may underestimate portfolio volatility.\n3. Manager selection risk: Alternative investment performance is highly manager-dependent, with a wider dispersion between top- and bottom-quartile managers.\n4. Fee drag: Alternatives charge higher fees (typically 1.5-2% management plus 15-20% carry), reducing net returns.\n5. Commitment uncertainty: Private funds require capital commitment management (pacing) and create unfunded obligation risk.\n\n**Recommendation:** A moderate increase in alternatives (to 20-22%) paired with a modest reduction in fixed income (to 23-25%) may be more appropriate than the full 30% proposed. This balances the need for higher returns with liquidity and governance constraints.\n\n**Part C: Rebalancing Policy Recommendation**\n\n1. **Approach:** A combination of calendar-based and percentage-of-portfolio (tolerance band) approach. Review allocations monthly; rebalance if any asset class exceeds its tolerance band. Conduct a comprehensive rebalancing assessment quarterly regardless of band triggers.\n\n2. **Tolerance bands:**\n   - US Equity: +/-5% (30-40%)\n   - International Equity: +/-4% (16-24%)\n   - Fixed Income: +/-5% (25-35%)\n   - Alternatives: +/-3% (12-18%) \u2014 narrower band due to illiquidity\n\n   Wider bands for more liquid and volatile asset classes (equities) reduce unnecessary transaction costs from frequent rebalancing. Narrower bands for alternatives prevent excessive drift.\n\n3. **Illiquid alternatives handling:**\n   - Rebalancing of the alternatives allocation should be accomplished primarily through cash flow management: directing new contributions and distributions to underweight asset classes rather than buying/selling illiquid holdings.\n   - The liquid portion of the portfolio (equities and bonds) should be rebalanced to maintain their relative target weights, adjusted for the alternatives allocation drift.\n   - Monitor the committed-but-unfunded portion of alternatives as part of the total allocation assessment.\n   - Use public market proxies (e.g., listed REITs for real estate exposure) as temporary bridging allocations when alternatives drift below target and new fund commitments have not yet been deployed."

      "title": "**Scenario 2: Private Wealth \u2014 Tax-Efficient Portfolio Management**\n\nDr. Maria Santos, age 52, is a cardiologist earning $600,000 annually. She has the following assets:\n\n| Account | Value | Account Type |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Taxable brokerage | $3,000,000 | Individual |\n| Traditional IRA | $1,500,000 | Tax-deferred |\n| Roth IRA | $500,000 | Tax-exempt |\n| Company stock (concentrated) | $2,000,000 (basis: $200,000) | Taxable |\n| Primary residence | $1,200,000 | Personal |\n\nTax rates: Ordinary income: 37%; Long-term capital gains: 23.8% (including NIIT); Qualified dividends: 23.8%; State income tax: 5%. She plans to retire at 62 and expects to live until 92.\n\n**Part A (4 points):** Design an asset location strategy for Dr. Santos's portfolio. Specify which asset classes should be held in each account type (taxable, tax-deferred, tax-exempt) and explain the rationale.\n\n**Part B (4 points):** The company stock ($2M, basis $200K) represents 25% of her investable assets. Outline a 5-year diversification plan that minimizes tax impact, including at least three specific strategies.\n\n**Part C (4 points):** Dr. Santos is considering converting $200,000 of her Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA this year. Analyze whether this conversion is advisable given her current and expected future tax situation.",
      "solution": "**Part A: Asset Location Strategy**\n\nThe goal is to place the most tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts and the most tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.\n\n**Tax-Deferred (Traditional IRA \u2014 $1.5M):**\n- Taxable bonds and bond funds (interest taxed at ordinary income rates of 37% + 5% state = 42%)\n- REITs (distributions taxed as ordinary income)\n- High-turnover active equity strategies (frequent short-term capital gains)\n\n*Rationale:* These asset classes generate income taxed at the highest ordinary income rates. Deferring this income into a tax-deferred account postpones the tax until withdrawal, when Dr. Santos may be in a lower tax bracket (post-retirement).\n\n**Tax-Exempt (Roth IRA \u2014 $500K):**\n- Highest expected return assets: small-cap growth equities, emerging markets, or alternatives\n- Assets with the longest expected holding period (growth stocks with high unrealized gain potential)\n\n*Rationale:* The Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals. Placing the highest expected growth assets here maximizes the value of the tax-free compounding. Additionally, Roth IRAs have no required minimum distributions, allowing extended compounding.\n\n**Taxable Brokerage ($3.0M + $2.0M company stock):**\n- Tax-managed equity index funds (low turnover, minimal distributions)\n- Municipal bonds (tax-exempt interest is most valuable for a 42% marginal rate taxpayer)\n- Individual stocks held for long-term (preferential capital gains rate)\n- The company stock (until diversified)\n\n*Rationale:* Taxable accounts should hold assets that generate tax-efficient returns: qualified dividends (23.8%), long-term capital gains (23.8%), or tax-exempt income (municipal bonds). Low-turnover equity strategies minimize taxable events.\n\n**Part B: Company Stock Diversification Plan (5 Years)**\n\nThe embedded gain is $1.8M ($2M market value - $200K basis). At 23.8% federal + 5% state = 28.8%, immediate full liquidation would cost approximately $518,400 in taxes.\n\n**Strategy 1: Systematic Annual Sales**\n- Sell $400,000 of company stock per year over 5 years\n- Each year's $360,000 gain ($400K \u00d7 $1,800/$2,000) incurs approximately $103,700 in tax\n- Spreading the sales may keep the client in a lower NIIT bracket in some years, and allows capital gains to be offset by any tax losses in the taxable portfolio\n- By retirement (age 57-62), the position will be fully diversified\n\n**Strategy 2: Charitable Giving of Appreciated Stock**\n- Donate appreciated company stock directly to Dr. Santos's donor-advised fund or favorite charities\n- She avoids the capital gains tax entirely and receives a charitable deduction equal to the fair market value (limited to 30% of AGI for appreciated capital gain property)\n- At $600K income and 30% AGI limit: up to $180K/year in deductible charitable gifts\n- Over 5 years, she could donate up to $900K of stock, avoiding approximately $250K in taxes\n\n**Strategy 3: Zero-Cost Collar for Immediate Protection**\n- Implement a zero-cost collar on the remaining company stock position immediately (buy put at 90% of current price, sell call at 115%)\n- This provides downside protection from the first day while the systematic sales and charitable giving plan proceeds\n- Does not trigger a taxable event (unlike selling)\n\n**Strategy 4: Exchange Fund (if available)**\n- Contribute a portion of the company stock to an exchange fund, receiving a diversified interest in a pool of appreciated stocks from multiple contributors\n- Capital gains tax is deferred until the exchange fund interest is sold (typically 7+ years)\n- Must hold for 7 years to avoid partnership gain recognition\n\n**Strategy 5: Tax-Loss Harvesting Coordination**\n- Actively harvest losses in the taxable brokerage portfolio to offset gains realized from company stock sales\n- This effectively reduces the net tax on the diversification program\n\n**Part C: Roth Conversion Analysis**\n\n**Current situation:** Dr. Santos is in the highest marginal tax bracket (37% federal + 5% state = 42% combined). Converting $200,000 would cost approximately $84,000 in taxes.\n\n**Arguments FOR conversion:**\n1. If tax rates increase in the future (political/legislative risk), converting now locks in the current rate\n2. Roth IRA has no RMDs, providing estate planning flexibility (beneficiaries receive tax-free distributions)\n3. At age 52 with 40 years of potential compounding, the tax-free growth is valuable\n4. Roth assets provide tax diversification in retirement (she can draw from taxable, tax-deferred, or tax-free accounts to manage her tax bracket)\n\n**Arguments AGAINST conversion:**\n1. Her current marginal rate (42%) is likely higher than her retirement rate. If her retirement income (Social Security + IRA withdrawals) puts her in the 24% bracket, she would save approximately 18% by deferring the tax\n2. The $84,000 tax payment reduces her investable assets\n3. At $600K income, she is paying the highest marginal rate \u2014 conversion adds income to an already high-bracket year\n\n**Recommendation:** The Roth conversion is **likely inadvisable** at this time. The 42% current rate almost certainly exceeds her future retirement rate. The conversion would be more attractive in years when her income is lower (e.g., after retirement but before Social Security begins, or in a year with significant deductions). She should consider smaller conversions ($50-100K) in future lower-income years to fill up lower tax brackets in retirement."

      "title": "**Scenario 3: Portfolio Construction \u2014 Equity Manager Selection and Risk Budgeting**\n\nNorthland Pension Fund has a $5 billion total fund with a 45% allocation to domestic equities ($2.25 billion). The fund's equity benchmark is the Russell 3000. The board has approved a total active risk budget of 2.5% tracking error for the equity portfolio.\n\nThe fund currently uses three equity managers:\n\n| Manager | Style | AUM ($M) | Expected Alpha | TE | IR | Correlation with other managers' active returns |\n|---------|-------|----------|---------------|-----|------|-------|\n| Summit Growth | Large Growth | 900 | 1.8% | 5.0% | 0.36 | 0.20 with both |\n| Valor Partners | Large Value | 750 | 1.2% | 3.5% | 0.34 | 0.20 with Summit, 0.10 with Quant |\n| Quant Alpha | Multi-cap Quant | 600 | 2.5% | 6.0% | 0.42 | 0.20 with Summit, 0.10 with Valor |\n\n**Part A (4 points):** Calculate the weighted active risk contribution and portfolio-level tracking error.

The board wants to terminate the manager. As the CIO, present the argument for and against termination, using the fundamental law of active management and the available data.\n\n**Part C (4 points):** The board is considering adding a passive index fund to reduce total tracking error. Calculate how much of the equity portfolio would need to be allocated to the index fund (with zero active risk) to bring tracking error to exactly 2.5%, assuming the remaining active allocation is split proportionally among the three managers.",
      "solution": "**Part A: Active Risk Calculation**\n\nWeights (proportion of equity portfolio):\n- Summit: $900M / $2,250M = 0.40\n- Valor: $750M / $2,250M = 0.333\n- Quant: $600M / $2,250M = 0.267\n\nPortfolio tracking error with correlated active returns:\n\n$$TE_p = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\sum_j w_i w_j TE_i TE_j \\rho_{ij}}$$\n\nExpanding:\n$$TE_p^2 = w_S^2 TE_S^2 + w_V^2 TE_V^2 + w_Q^2 TE_Q^2 + 2 w_S w_V TE_S TE_V \\rho_{SV} + 2 w_S w_Q TE_S TE_Q \\rho_{SQ} + 2 w_V w_Q TE_V TE_Q \\rho_{VQ}$$\n\nSubstituting values:\n$$= (0.40)^2(5.0)^2 + (0.333)^2(3.5)^2 + (0.267)^2(6.0)^2$$\n$$+ 2(0.40)(0.333)(5.0)(3.5)(0.20)$$\n$$+ 2(0.40)(0.267)(5.0)(6.0)(0.20)$$\n$$+ 2(0.333)(0.267)(3.5)(6.0)(0.10)$$\n\n$$= 0.16 \\times 25 + 0.111 \\times 12.25 + 0.0713 \\times 36$$\n$$+ 2(0.40)(0.333)(3.5)(0.20)$$\n$$+ 2(0.40)(0.267)(6.4)(0.20)$$\n$$+ 2(0.333)(0.267)(1.87)(0.10)$$\n\nLet me recalculate more carefully:\n$$= 4.00 + 1.36 + 2.57$$\n$$+ 2(0.40)(0.333)(5.0)(3.5)(0.20) = 2(0.40)(0.333)(3.50) = 0.933$$\n$$+ 2(0.40)(0.267)(5.0)(6.0)(0.20) = 2(0.40)(0.267)(6.0) = 1.281$$\n$$+ 2(0.333)(0.267)(3.5)(6.0)(0.10) = 2(0.333)(0.267)(2.10) = 0.373$$\n\n$$TE_p^2 = 4.00 + 1.36 + 2.57 + 0.933 + 1.281 + 0.373 = 10.52$$\n\n$$TE_p = \\sqrt{10.52} \\approx 3.24\\%$$\n\n**The current structure exceeds the 2.5% risk budget by approximately 0.74%.** The portfolio is not compliant.\n\n**Part B: Termination Analysis \u2014 Arguments For and Against**\n\n**Arguments FOR termination:**\n1. The 300 bps underperformance over 18 months is significant \u2014 roughly 1.5 standard deviations below expected alpha given a 6% TE\n2. The board's patience may be limited, and continued underperformance erodes confidence in the investment program\n3. The current tracking error exceeds the risk budget; removing Quant Alpha (the highest TE manager) would help bring the portfolio into compliance\n\n**Arguments AGAINST termination:**\n1. **Insufficient time horizon:** 18 months is too short to evaluate a manager with statistical confidence. With an IR of 0.42 and TE of 6%, the expected t-statistic of alpha after 18 months is approximately $0.42 \\times \\sqrt{1.5} = 0.51$, which is far below statistical significance. The -300 bps could easily be noise.\n\n2. **Highest IR manager:** Quant Alpha has the highest information ratio (0.42) of the three managers, indicating the best expected risk-adjusted skill. Terminating based on short-term results destroys the long-term value of this selection.\n\n3. **Fundamental law analysis:** Using $IR = IC \\times \\sqrt{BR}$, Quant Alpha's multi-cap quantitative strategy likely has the highest breadth (hundreds or thousands of independent bets). This implies that the expected alpha is well-diversified across many positions, and the recent underperformance is likely mean-reverting.\n\n4. **Process evaluation:** If the manager's investment process, team, and risk controls are intact, the underperformance is likely cyclical rather than structural. The board should evaluate the manager's process, not just outcomes.\n\n5. **Behavioral bias:** Terminating after underperformance is a form of recency bias. Studies show that terminated managers often outperform their replacements in subsequent periods.\n\n**Recommendation:** Retain Quant Alpha but monitor closely. Set a clear benchmark for evaluation (e.g., rolling 3-year IR) and reassess after 12-18 more months. Address the tracking error budget issue separately (see Part C).\n\n**Part C: Passive Allocation to Achieve 2.5% TE**\n\nLet $x$ = the proportion allocated to the passive index fund (TE = 0). The remaining $(1-x)$ is allocated proportionally among the three managers (maintaining their relative weights).\n\nThe active managers' proportional weights become:\n- Summit: $0.40(1-x)$\n- Valor: $0.333(1-x)$  \n- Quant: $0.267(1-x)$\n\nSince the passive allocation has zero active risk, the portfolio TE scales linearly with $(1-x)$:\n\n$$TE_{new} = (1-x) \\times TE_{current} = (1-x) \\times 3.24\\%$$\n\nSetting $TE_{new} = 2.5\\%$:\n\n$$2.5\\% = (1-x) \\times 3.24\\%$$\n$$1-x = 2.5/3.24 = 0.7716$$\n$$x = 0.2284 \\approx 22.8\\%$$\n\nApproximately **22.8% of the equity portfolio ($514 million)** should be allocated to the passive index fund to bring the total active risk to exactly 2.5%.\n\nThe resulting allocation would be:\n- Passive Index: $514M (22.8%)\n- Summit Growth: $695M (30.9%)\n- Valor Partners: $579M (25.7%)\n- Quant Alpha: $463M (20.6%)\n\n**Expected portfolio alpha with passive allocation:** $(1-0.228) \\times \\text{weighted active alpha}$\n\nWeighted active alpha = $0.40(1.8\\%) + 0.333(1.2\\%) + 0.267(2.5\\%) = 0.72 + 0.40 + 0.67 = 1.79\\%$\n\nPortfolio alpha = $0.772 \\times 1.79\\% = 1.38\\%$\n\nPortfolio IR = $1.38\\% / 2.5\\% = 0.55$, which is actually a strong information ratio."

      "title": "**Scenario 4: Ethics \u2014 Multi-Stakeholder Conflict**\n\nJennifer Wu, CFA, is a senior portfolio manager at Global Asset Management (GAM), which manages $50 billion in institutional assets. GAM claims GIPS compliance. The following situations arise during Q3:\n\n**Situation 1:** GAM's marketing department creates a new presentation for the International Small Cap composite showing 10-year annualized returns. The composite was created 3 years ago by combining the track records of two previously separate strategies (International and Small Cap) that were merged. The marketing team presents the pre-merger performance as if the composite had existed for 10 years.\n\n**Situation 2:** Wu manages a large pension client and a smaller foundation client. A hot IPO allocation of 50,000 shares arrives. Wu allocates 45,000 shares to the pension client (which generates $3M in annual fees) and 5,000 shares to the foundation (which generates $200K in annual fees).\n\n**Situation 3:** Wu's husband works at a pharmaceutical company and mentions at dinner that his company will be acquired by a larger firm. The deal has not been publicly announced. Wu does not trade on the information but tells her firm's biotech analyst 'to take a close look at pharma acquisitions.'\n\n**Part A (4 points):** Identify all CFA Institute Standards and/or GIPS provisions violated in Situation 1. Explain the correct treatment.\n\n**Part B (4 points):** Identify all Standards violated in Situation 2. Describe how the IPO allocation should have been handled.\n\n**Part C (4 points):** Analyze whether Wu's actions in Situation 3 violate any Standards. Consider both her decision not to trade and her comment to the analyst.",
      "solution": "**Part A: Situation 1 \u2014 GIPS and Misrepresentation Violations**\n\n**Violations:**\n\n1. **GIPS Standards \u2014 Composite Construction:** GIPS requires that composites represent actual investment strategies that were managed as such. Combining the track records of two previously separate strategies to create a 10-year history for a composite that has only existed for 3 years violates the composite construction requirements. The composite can only present performance from its inception date (3 years ago).\n\n2. **GIPS \u2014 Portability of Track Records:** If the merged strategy is truly a continuation of one of the prior strategies (same team, same process), the prior strategy's track record may be portable. However, combining TWO different strategies' results into a single composite is never permissible, as it creates a hypothetical performance record.\n\n3. **Standard I(C) Misrepresentation:** Presenting a simulated 10-year track record as if it were actual composite performance is a misrepresentation of the firm's investment record.\n\n4. **Standard V(B) Communication with Clients:** The presentation fails to accurately communicate the history of the composite.\n\n**Correct Treatment:**\n- The composite should present performance only from its inception date (3 years ago)\n- If one of the predecessor strategies was substantially similar, that track record (and only that single strategy's record) may be linked with appropriate disclosure\n- The presentation must clearly disclose the merger date, the predecessor strategies, and any methodological differences\n- The marketing department should consult compliance before creating any performance presentations\n\n**Part B: Situation 2 \u2014 IPO Allocation Violations**\n\n**Violations:**\n\n1. **Standard III(B) Fair Dealing:** Wu must deal fairly and objectively with all clients. Allocating 90% of the IPO to the larger fee-paying client and only 10% to the smaller client suggests the allocation is based on fee revenue rather than an objective, predetermined methodology.\n\n2. **Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care:** Wu has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of each client. Favoring one client over another based on fee revenue violates this duty to the disadvantaged client.\n\n3. **Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts:** If the firm has a policy of favoring larger clients in allocations (which it should not), this must be disclosed.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n- The firm should have a **written IPO allocation policy** established in advance\n- Allocations should be made on a **pro-rata basis** relative to account size, or based on suitability (which accounts are appropriate for the IPO)\n- If both accounts are suitable and similarly sized, allocation should be proportional to account size. Pension ($3M fees, presumably larger AUM) and Foundation ($200K fees, presumably smaller AUM) would receive shares in proportion to their portfolio sizes\n- If the IPO is oversubscribed, partial fills should be distributed fairly\n- The allocation methodology and any deviations must be documented\n- Wu should not consider fee revenue in making allocation decisions\n\n**Part C: Situation 3 \u2014 MNPI Analysis**\n\n**Wu's decision not to trade:** This was correct. Standard II(A) prohibits acting on material nonpublic information. The pending acquisition of her husband's employer is clearly material (it would affect the stock price) and nonpublic (not yet announced). By not trading, Wu avoided a direct violation.\n\n**Wu's comment to the analyst:** This **likely violates** Standard II(A). While Wu did not explicitly share the MNPI, her directed comment ('take a close look at pharma acquisitions') constitutes a form of 'tipping' \u2014 providing guidance that could lead the analyst to uncover and trade on the information. The analysis:\n\n1. **Mosaic theory defense?** The mosaic theory allows analysts to combine non-material, public information to form an investment conclusion. However, Wu's tip was not based on public information assembled through analysis \u2014 it was directly motivated by MNPI she received from her husband.\n\n2. **'Causing others to act':** Standard II(A) prohibits not only acting on MNPI but also 'causing others to act.' By directing the analyst toward pharma acquisitions, Wu created the conditions for the analyst to discover and potentially trade on the information.\n\n3. **Standard IV(A) Loyalty:** Wu may have also created a liability for her firm by exposing it to potential insider trading violations.\n\n**Recommended action:** Wu should have:\n- Not discussed the information with anyone at the firm\n- Reported the receipt of MNPI to the compliance department\n- Ensured the pharmaceutical company's securities were placed on a restricted list until the acquisition was publicly announced\n- Disclosed the spousal relationship conflict to compliance"

      "solution": "**Part A: Beta Reduction Using Futures**\n\nNumber of contracts to sell:\n\n$$N_f = \\frac{\\beta_{target} - \\beta_{portfolio}}{\\beta_{futures}} \\times \\frac{V_{portfolio}}{\\text{Futures Price} \\times \\text{Multiplier}}$$\n\nAssuming $\\beta_{futures} = 1.0$:\n\n$$N_f = \\frac{0.70 - 1.05}{1.0} \\times \\frac{\\$1{,}200{,}000{,}000}{5{,}000 \\times \\$250}$$\n\n$$= -0.35 \\times \\frac{1{,}200{,}000{,}000}{1{,}250{,}000} = -0.35 \\times 960 = -336$$\n\n**The fund should sell 336 S&P 500 futures contracts** to reduce the domestic equity beta from 1.05 to 0.70.\n\nVerification: The notional value hedged is $336 \\times 1{,}250{,}000 = \\$420{,}000{,}000$. This represents $420M / $1,200M = 35% of the equity portfolio, which is consistent with reducing beta by 0.35 (from 1.05 to 0.70).\n\n**Part B: Options-Based Protection Strategy**\n\n**Recommended Strategy: Put Spread Collar (Financed Put Spread)**\n\nTo protect against >10% decline while keeping cost <1% of $1.2B (<$12M):\n\n1. **Buy 6-month put options** on the S&P 500 with strikes at 90% of current level (4,500)\n   - These puts provide protection below the 10% decline threshold\n   - Approximate cost: 2.5-3.0% of notional\n\n2. **Sell 6-month put options** with strikes at 75% of current level (3,750)\n   - This caps the protection at a 25% decline, reducing the cost\n   - Approximate premium received: 0.8-1.0% of notional\n\n3. **Sell 6-month call options** with strikes at 108% of current level (5,400)\n   - This caps the upside, further reducing or eliminating the net cost\n   - Approximate premium received: 1.5-2.0% of notional\n\n**Net structure (put spread collar):**\n- Net cost: approximately $0 to 0.5% of portfolio (<$6M) \u2014 within the 1% budget\n- Protection: losses between -10% and -25% are hedged\n- Maximum loss: the first 10% decline is unprotected\n- Upside capped: gains above +8% are surrendered\n- Losses beyond -25% are unprotected (tail risk remains)\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- The cap on upside (+8%) limits the portfolio's return in a strong market rally\n- The put spread limits protection to -25%; a crash beyond this level is unprotected\n- Basis risk if the portfolio does not track the S&P 500 exactly\n- The options expire in 6 months and must be rolled (at additional cost) if the concern persists\n\n**Part C: Currency Hedging**\n\nInternational equity: $600M total\n- EUR exposure: 60% \u00d7 $600M = $360M\n- JPY exposure: 40% \u00d7 $600M = $240M\n\n**Forward contracts needed:**\n- EUR hedge (75%): Sell EUR $360M \u00d7 0.75 = **$270M notional** in EUR/USD forwards\n- JPY hedge (50%): Sell JPY $240M \u00d7 0.50 = **$120M notional** in JPY/USD forwards\n\n**Impact of currency movements:**\n\n*Without hedging:*\n- EUR depreciates 5%: Loss = $360M \u00d7 (-5%) = -$18M\n- JPY appreciates 3%: Gain = $240M \u00d7 3% = +$7.2M\n- Net currency impact: -$10.8M\n\n*With partial hedging:*\n\n**EUR exposure:**\n- Hedged portion (75%, $270M): Protected from EUR depreciation.

Their combined estate:\n\n| Asset | Value | Owner | Notes |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Family business (S-corp) | $12,000,000 | Robert (100%) | Basis: $500,000 |\n| Investment portfolio | $4,000,000 | Joint | Diversified, basis: $3,000,000 |\n| Retirement accounts | $3,000,000 | Split | Traditional IRAs |\n| Personal residence | $1,500,000 | Joint | Primary home |\n| Life insurance | $2,000,000 | Robert | Term policy, no ILIT |\n| **Total estate** | **$22,500,000** | | |\n\nAssumptions: Estate tax exemption: $13 million per person ($26M combined with portability). Estate tax rate: 40%. The Hayes have three adult children. They want to: (1) transfer the business to their daughter Sarah who works in the business, (2) provide equal value to all three children, and (3) minimize estate taxes.\n\n**Part A (4 points):** Analyze whether the Hayes family faces an estate tax liability under current law. Calculate the projected tax, if any.\n\n**Part B (4 points):** Design a succession plan for the family business that transfers ownership to Sarah while treating all three children equitably. Address both control and economic interests.\n\n**Part C (4 points):** Robert's $2 million life insurance policy is currently owned personally. Explain how restructuring the insurance ownership could reduce the estate tax liability, and describe the implementation steps.",
      "solution": "**Part A: Estate Tax Analysis**\n\nTotal estate: $22,500,000\nCombined exemption: $26,000,000 (with portability)\n\nSince the total estate ($22.5M) is below the combined exemption ($26M), **the Hayes family does not currently face a federal estate tax liability under current law.**\n\nHowever, several risk factors should be considered:\n\n1. **Business appreciation:** If the business grows at 5% annually, it will be worth approximately $15.5M in 5 years and $19.5M in 10 years. Total estate could exceed $26M within 7-10 years.\n\n2. **Exemption sunset risk:** The current $13M exemption (per person) is scheduled to sunset (potentially reverting to ~$6-7M per person) under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If the exemption drops to $7M per person ($14M combined), the Hayes would face a taxable estate of $22.5M - $14M = $8.5M, resulting in a tax of approximately **$3.4 million** (40% \u00d7 $8.5M).\n\n3. **Retirement account growth:** IRA assets will continue to grow (no RMDs were required before age 73) and are subject to both income tax on withdrawal and estate tax on the balance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Even though no tax is currently owed, proactive planning is essential given the sunset risk and potential asset appreciation.\n\n**Part B: Business Succession Plan**\n\nThe business ($12M) represents 53% of the estate. Transferring it entirely to Sarah while treating all three children equitably requires a comprehensive plan:\n\n**Step 1: Business Valuation and Discount**\n- Obtain a qualified business appraisal. The $12M value may be subject to minority interest and marketability discounts of 25-35% for transfer purposes.\n- Discounted value for estate/gift tax purposes: approximately $7.8M-$9.0M\n\n**Step 2: Restructure to Separate Control and Economic Interests**\n- Convert the S-corp to an LLC with two classes of interests:\n  - **Voting units (10%):** Give to Sarah to ensure she controls business operations\n  - **Non-voting units (90%):** Distribute among all three children or retain for economic distribution\n\n**Step 3: Gradual Transfer**\n- Use annual gift tax exclusions ($17,000 per recipient \u00d7 2 donors = $34,000/year per child) to gift non-voting units to all three children\n- Use a grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) to transfer a larger block of non-voting units. The GRAT provides Robert an annuity stream while the remainder passes to the children at a reduced gift tax value.\n- Use an intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT) for an installment sale of business interests to Sarah. Robert sells business interests to the trust in exchange for a promissory note. The sale is not a taxable event for income tax purposes (because it's a grantor trust), and the business appreciation occurs outside Robert's estate.\n\n**Step 4: Equalization for Non-Business Children**\n- Allocate the investment portfolio ($4M) and retirement accounts ($3M) to the other two children\n- Use life insurance proceeds ($2M) to further equalize\n- Total for non-business children: approximately $4.5M each (from investments, retirement, and insurance) vs. Sarah's business interest (valued at $12M but with discount and sweat equity considerations)\n- An equalization provision in the estate plan can adjust distributions based on the business's actual value at Robert's death\n\n**Part C: Life Insurance Restructuring**\n\nCurrently, Robert's $2M life insurance policy is personally owned. This means the death benefit is included in his taxable estate.\n\n**Problem:** If the estate grows beyond the exemption amount, $2M of life insurance proceeds are added to the taxable estate, potentially generating $800,000 in estate tax (40% \u00d7 $2M). The insurance proceeds \u2014 intended to provide liquidity and equalize inheritances \u2014 are partially consumed by tax.\n\n**Solution: Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)**\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n\n1. **Establish the ILIT:** An attorney drafts an irrevocable trust with the three children as beneficiaries. Robert and Catherine cannot be trustees.\n\n2. **Transfer the policy:** Robert transfers ownership of the existing $2M policy to the ILIT. This is a taxable gift (the value is the policy's interpolated terminal reserve value, typically much less than the death benefit for a term policy).\n\n3. **Three-year rule:** If Robert dies within 3 years of the transfer, the policy proceeds are still included in his estate (IRC Section 2035). To mitigate this risk, the ILIT could purchase a new policy (no 3-year rule applies) and Robert could cancel the old one, or simply accept the 3-year risk.\n\n4. **Premium payments:** The ILIT needs funding for premium payments. Robert and Catherine make annual gifts to the ILIT (within the annual exclusion, using Crummey withdrawal powers to qualify as present interest gifts). The trustee uses the gifts to pay premiums.\n\n5. **Tax result:** Upon Robert's death, the $2M death benefit is paid to the ILIT, **not to Robert's estate**. The proceeds are excluded from the taxable estate, potentially saving $800,000 in estate taxes.\n\n6. **Trust proceeds usage:** The ILIT trustee can use the $2M to purchase assets from Robert's estate (providing estate liquidity), make loans to the estate, or distribute to the children per the trust terms."

Explain the trade-offs of each recommendation.",
      "solution": "**Part A: Return Adequacy Analysis**\n\nWeighted-average expected return:\n\n$$E(R_p) = 0.30(8.0\\%) + 0.15(8.5\\%) + 0.10(10.0\\%) + 0.20(3.5\\%)$$\n$$+ 0.10(7.0\\%) + 0.10(12.0\\%) + 0.05(2.0\\%)$$\n$$= 2.40 + 1.275 + 1.00 + 0.70 + 0.70 + 1.20 + 0.10 = 7.375\\%$$\n\nMinimum required return:\n$$r_{min} = (1.05)(1.025)(1.003) - 1 = 7.94\\%$$\n\nThe portfolio's expected return (7.375%) **falls short** of the minimum required return (7.94%) by approximately 57 bps.\n\n**Implications:**\n- The foundation is on a path toward real spending declines or asset depletion\n- Either the spending rate must be reduced, the allocation must shift toward higher-returning (and higher-risk) assets, or the spending policy must incorporate a ratchet-down mechanism\n- Without new contributions, the shortfall will compound over time\n\n**Part B: Stress Test \u2014 2008-Style Scenario**\n\n| Asset Class | Current Value ($M) | Stress Return | Stressed Value ($M) |\n|-------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| US Large Cap | 150 | -40% | 90.0 |\n| International Eq | 75 | -40% | 45.0 |\n| Emerging Markets | 50 | -40% | 30.0 |\n| Core Fixed Income | 100 | +5% | 105.0 |\n| Real Assets | 50 | -25% | 37.5 |\n| Private Equity | 50 | -35% | 32.5 |\n| Cash | 25 | 0% | 25.0 |\n| **Total** | **500** | | **365.0** |\n\n**Portfolio loss:** $500M - $365M = **$135M (27.0% decline)**\n\n**Years of spending at $25M/year:**\n$$365M / 25M = **14.6 years**$$\n\nHowever, this assumes no recovery and no reduction in spending. In reality:\n- The foundation should reduce spending in the year following a major downturn (dynamic spending policy)\n- The portfolio would likely recover partially within 2-3 years\n- The 14.6-year estimate is a worst-case static analysis\n\n**More concerning:** After the downturn, the 5% spending rate applied to $365M is $18.25M, not $25M. If the board maintains $25M spending, it would be withdrawing 6.85% of assets, which is unsustainable.\n\n**Part C: Risk Management Recommendations**\n\n**1. Implement a Dynamic Spending Policy**\n\nReplace the fixed 5% spending rate with a hybrid rule:\n$$S_t = 0.70 \\times S_{t-1} \\times (1 + \\pi) + 0.30 \\times 5\\% \\times MV_t$$\n\nThis smooths spending (70% based on prior year) while linking to market value (30%), automatically reducing spending after market declines.\n\n*Trade-off:* Reduced spending in bad years may affect the foundation's charitable mission. The board must balance mission continuity with portfolio sustainability.\n\n**2. Add Tail Risk Hedging**\n\nPurchase portfolio insurance using equity put options or structured products:\n- Buy 6-month S&P 500 put options at 85% of current level (15% OTM)\n- Cost: approximately 1.0-1.5% of equity portfolio annually (approximately $3-4M)\n- In a 40% equity decline, the puts would pay approximately $30-40M, significantly cushioning the impact\n\n*Trade-off:* The insurance cost (1.0-1.5% annually) is a drag on returns in normal years. Over time, the cumulative cost can be substantial if not needed. Consider using put spreads to reduce cost.\n\n**3. Maintain a Liquidity Reserve**\n\nIncrease cash/short-term reserves from 5% ($25M) to 10-12% ($50-60M), providing 2+ years of spending without selling assets during a downturn.\n\n*Trade-off:* The higher cash allocation reduces expected return (cash earns 2% vs. the portfolio's 7.4%). This exacerbates the existing return shortfall. The foundation must weigh short-term resilience against long-term spending sustainability.\n\n**4. Reduce Private Equity and Illiquid Allocations in Favor of Liquid Alternatives**\n\nReduce PE from 10% to 5% and reallocate to liquid alternatives (hedge funds with monthly liquidity, or liquid real return strategies). This improves the portfolio's ability to rebalance during crises without fire sales.\n\n*Trade-off:* Private equity has the highest expected return (12%). Reducing the allocation lowers expected returns further but improves liquidity and the ability to rebalance opportunistically.\n\n**5. Establish a Rebalancing Protocol for Distressed Markets**\n\nPre-commit to a rebalancing policy that buys equities when they fall to predetermined allocation thresholds (e.g., if equities fall below 40% of portfolio, rebalance to 45%). This 'buy the dip' discipline has historically improved long-term returns but requires liquidity and emotional discipline.\n\n*Trade-off:* Rebalancing into a falling market requires the conviction and governance to execute. The board must pre-commit to this policy during calm markets; attempting to decide during a crisis typically results in paralysis or pro-cyclical selling."
