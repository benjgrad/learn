      "vignette": "Consolidated Industries sponsors a defined benefit pension plan with $4 billion in assets and $4.5 billion in liabilities (PBO), resulting in a funded ratio of 88.9%. The plan's liability duration is 13.5 years, and the workforce is 55% active participants and 45% retirees.\n\nThe plan's current allocation is: 50% equities (beta 1.0), 35% investment-grade bonds (duration 7.0), 10% alternatives (hedge funds and PE), and 5% cash. The plan's investment committee is reviewing the allocation given the underfunded status.\n\nThe plan's actuary has calculated that each 1% decline in discount rates increases PBO by approximately $600 million. The plan's required contribution is projected at $150 million next year. Consolidated Industries has a BBB credit rating and moderate cash flow stability.\n\nThe committee is debating three proposals:\n- Proposal A: Increase equities to 60% to generate higher returns and close the funding gap\n- Proposal B: Implement a 50% LDI hedge (increase bond duration to match liability duration on 50% of assets) while maintaining 40% equities and 10% alternatives\n- Proposal C: Maintain the current allocation and increase annual contributions by $50 million",

            "A) The risk that equity returns are too high, causing the plan to become overfunded",

          "explanation": "The most critical risk is the interaction between interest rate risk, funding status, and corporate financial health. A decline in rates increases the PBO ($600M per 1% decline) while minimally affecting assets (only 35% in bonds with 7-year duration).

The portfolio manager requested the change to improve his personal track record.\n\nIssue 2: A senior advisor, James Park, CFA, regularly receives expensive bottles of wine (valued at $200-500 each) from a broker-dealer. Park directs most of his client trades to this broker. The firm has no gift policy.\n\nIssue 3: The firm's performance presentations show trailing returns for all composites but do not include the number of portfolios in each composite, composite assets, or total firm assets.\n\nIssue 4: Torres discovers that two client portfolios have been inadvertently excluded from all composites for the past 2 years.

The fund sells JPY forward at 149.25, which is a stronger JPY rate than spot (150.00).

The portfolio effectively becomes a concentrated equity bet\n\nThe increase in correlations from -0.20 to +0.40 (bonds) and 0.40 to 0.80 (hedge funds) would increase portfolio volatility from approximately 10.2% to 12-14%, and the 2-standard-deviation loss would exceed the 20% drawdown limit. This 'correlation convergence' is one of the most important risk management lessons from 2008. Option A reverses the effect. Option C ignores the role of correlations in portfolio risk.",

          "options": [
            "A) Increase equity to 70% since equities recover fastest after a crisis",
            "B) Add an allocation to long-duration government bonds (reducing corporate bonds), include managed futures (trend-following strategies that have historically performed well during equity crises), and consider explicit tail-risk hedging through put options on the equity portfolio",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Crisis-resilient portfolio improvements:\n\n1. **Long-duration government bonds:** Pure duration exposure (treasuries, not corporates) tends to rally strongly during equity crises as investors flee to safety. Replacing corporate bond exposure with government bonds improves the negative correlation with equities during stress.\n\n2. **Managed futures (trend-following):** These strategies have historically generated positive returns during prolonged equity declines because they systematically short declining assets and go long rising assets. They provide genuine crisis diversification.\n\n3. **Tail-risk hedging:** Equity put options provide direct protection against large drawdowns. While expensive in normal markets, they specifically address the committee's 20% drawdown constraint.\n\nOption A increases crisis exposure. Option C destroys long-term returns and is impractical to time.",

It says nothing about the magnitude of losses beyond this point. The loss could be $200M, $300M, or more.\n\n2. **Normality assumption:** Parametric VaR assumes normally distributed returns. Equity returns have fat tails (extreme events occur more frequently than normal distribution predicts). The 2008 crisis would have been a 4-5 standard deviation event under normality -- virtually impossible -- yet it occurred.\n\n3. **Conditional VaR (CVaR):** The committee should supplement VaR with CVaR (Expected Shortfall), which estimates the average loss in the worst 5% of scenarios, providing information about tail severity.\n\nOption A treats VaR as a maximum (it is not).

      "vignette": "Pinnacle Asset Management (PAM) is a mid-sized firm with $15 billion in AUM, managing equity and fixed income strategies for institutional clients. PAM has adopted the CFA Institute Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct. During the annual compliance audit, the following findings emerge:\n\nFinding 1: PAM's best execution policy states that the firm will 'seek best execution for all client trades.' However, the audit reveals that 60% of equity trades are directed to a single broker-dealer that provides the firm with free Bloomberg terminal access and research reports. No formal best execution review has been conducted in 3 years.\n\nFinding 2: The firm's risk management function reports directly to the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), who is also responsible for portfolio management decisions.\n\nFinding 3: PAM aggregates (bundles) client trades for execution but does not have a written policy for allocating partially filled orders among participating accounts.\n\nFinding 4: The firm presents performance results in marketing materials using a 'representative account' rather than composites.",

          "options": [
            "A) The requirement to act in clients' best interests, specifically the obligation to seek best execution and to not use client brokerage to pay for services that benefit the firm rather than clients without full disclosure",

          "explanation": "Finding 1 raises multiple concerns under the Asset Manager Code:\n\n1. **Best execution:** The concentration of 60% of trades with one broker, motivated by free services rather than execution quality, suggests that best execution may not be achieved. The Asset Manager Code requires firms to seek best execution and to have policies and procedures to evaluate and compare execution quality.\n\n2. **Soft dollar/commission bundling:** The free Bloomberg terminals and research represent soft dollar arrangements. The Code requires these to be disclosed and used only to benefit clients.\n\n3. **Regular review:** The 3-year gap in best execution review violates the Code's requirement for ongoing monitoring.\n\nOption B addresses performance presentation (Finding 4, not Finding 1).

          "options": [
            "A) Risk management must always be outsourced to an independent third party",
            "B) The Asset Manager Code requires risk management to be functionally independent from portfolio management to ensure objective risk assessment; having risk management report to the CIO (who also manages portfolios) creates a conflict of interest and undermines the independence of the risk function",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The Asset Manager Code specifically requires that the risk management process be independent from portfolio management. When risk management reports to the CIO who also makes investment decisions, the risk manager may face pressure to approve risk limits, overlook breaches, or adjust risk models to accommodate the CIO's investment views. Best practice requires risk management to report to an independent Chief Risk Officer, the board, or a risk committee. Option A is too extreme (internal independence is sufficient). Option C is too broad (the CIO should be informed of risk, but should not control the risk function).",

          "explanation": "When a bundled order is only partially filled (e.g., the firm orders 100,000 shares for 10 clients but only receives 70,000), the allocation decision can create conflicts. Without a written policy: (1) profitable partial fills might be allocated to favored clients (high-fee, personal relationships, firm's own accounts), (2) unprofitable fills might be dumped on other clients, and (3) there is no audit trail to verify fair treatment. The Asset Manager Code requires written trade allocation policies that treat all clients fairly and equitably, with pro-rata allocation as the default approach for partial fills.

PAM claims GIPS compliance (through the Asset Manager Code's performance presentation requirements) but is violating it\n4. **Misleading:** Prospective clients may believe the representative account's performance is typical when it may be an outlier\n\nThe Asset Manager Code requires performance information to be fair, accurate, and not misleading.
