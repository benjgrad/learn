      "content": "## Three Approaches to Asset Allocation\n\n### 1. Asset-Only Approach\n\nFocuses on the **asset portfolio** in isolation, seeking to maximize risk-adjusted returns without explicit reference to liabilities or spending goals.\n\n- **Primary tool**: Mean-variance optimization (MVO)\n- **Risk measure**: Portfolio standard deviation or VaR\n- **Best suited for**: Investors without explicit liabilities (endowments, individuals in accumulation)\n- **Limitation**: Ignores the interaction between assets and obligations\n\n### 2. Liability-Relative Approach\n\nExplicitly considers the relationship between **assets and liabilities** (or obligations).\n\n- **Objective**: Minimize surplus risk or fund the liability stream\n- **Risk measure**: Surplus volatility = \u03c3(Assets \u2212 Liabilities)\n- **Best suited for**: DB pension funds, insurance companies, banks\n- **Key methods**:\n  - **Surplus optimization**: MVO applied to surplus (A \u2212 L)\n  - **Liability-driven investing (LDI)**: Duration-match assets to liabilities\n  - **Hedging/return-seeking portfolio**: Split assets into a liability-hedging portfolio and a return-seeking portfolio\n\n### 3. Goals-Based Approach\n\nSegments the portfolio into **sub-portfolios** aligned with specific goals, each with a probability of success.\n\n- **Objective**: Maximize probability of achieving each goal\n- **Best suited for**: Individual investors, private wealth clients, family offices\n- **Structure**: Mental accounting layers\n  - **Essential goals** (needs): High probability, conservative allocation\n  - **Important goals** (wants): Moderate probability, balanced allocation\n  - **Aspirational goals** (wishes): Lower probability, aggressive allocation"

      "question": "A university endowment with no explicit liabilities but a 5% annual spending requirement is deciding on an asset allocation approach. Which of the three approaches is most appropriate?",
      "answer": "The asset-only approach is most commonly used, as endowments have no explicit liabilities in the traditional sense. However, a strong case can be made for a hybrid: the spending requirement could be treated as a liability-like obligation (liability-relative), or the endowment could adopt a goals-based framework with goals like 'maintain real purchasing power' (essential) and 'grow to support new programs' (aspirational). In practice, most endowments use asset-only MVO with a return target at least equal to spending rate + inflation + costs."

Assets should be **relatively homogeneous**\n2. Asset classes should be **mutually exclusive**\n3. Asset classes should be **diversifying** (not perfectly correlated)\n4. Together, asset classes should make up a **preponderance** of investable wealth\n5. Each class should have **sufficient capacity** to absorb meaningful allocation\n\n### Currency Considerations\n\n- Currency exposure is a **separate risk factor** from asset class returns\n- Strategic currency hedging policy is part of SAA\n- Partial hedging is common (50-100% of foreign exposure)\n- Currency as a separate return source for TAA"

      "title": "Constructed Response: Selecting an Asset Allocation Approach",
      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Appropriate approach for each client:**\n\n**Corporate DB pension fund (80% funded):** Liability-relative approach. The fund has explicit, quantifiable liabilities (pension obligations). Being underfunded (80%) makes surplus risk management critical. A hedging/return-seeking portfolio structure would be appropriate: the hedging portfolio matches liability duration (predominantly long-duration bonds), while the return-seeking portfolio targets the return needed to close the funding gap.\n\n**High-net-worth individual, age 55, planning for retirement at 65:** Goals-based approach. The individual has multiple goals with different time horizons and priority levels:\n- Essential: Maintain living standard in retirement (high probability target, conservative sub-portfolio)\n- Important: Fund children's education, travel (moderate probability, balanced)\n- Aspirational: Leave significant legacy, philanthropic impact (lower probability, growth-oriented)\n\n**Sovereign wealth fund with intergenerational mandate:** Asset-only approach. The fund has no explicit liabilities, an extremely long time horizon, and an objective to maximize long-term real returns for future generations. MVO with constraints (liquidity, ESG) is appropriate, potentially enhanced with factor-based allocation given the fund's capacity to bear illiquidity.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Why the DB fund should not use asset-only:**\n\nAn asset-only approach for the DB fund would ignore the critical relationship between asset returns and liability movements. If both assets and liabilities are sensitive to interest rates, an asset-only optimization might recommend a portfolio that maximizes asset-only Sharpe ratio but has poor surplus risk characteristics \u2014 for example, overweighting equities while liabilities remain rate-sensitive. When rates fall, liabilities grow while the equity-heavy portfolio does not offset this. Surplus optimization ensures the asset portfolio hedges the liability exposure, reducing the risk of funding shortfalls."
