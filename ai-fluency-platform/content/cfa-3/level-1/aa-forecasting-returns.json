      "answer": "No. The 1.5% spread includes compensation for expected default losses and credit migration risk, not just the risk premium. The expected credit premium is the spread minus expected default losses minus a credit migration adjustment. If historical default losses on BBB bonds average ~0.3% annually, the expected premium might be closer to 1.0-1.1%, not the full 1.5% spread."

This suggests either:\n1. Equities are richly valued (the negative P/E repricing reflects this)\n2. The current fixed-income yield is historically elevated\n3. The expected equity premium is compressed\n\nRecommendation: The low implied ERP suggests a more conservative equity allocation than historical norms would dictate. However, the repricing component is the least reliable \u2014 if the economy avoids recession and earnings growth exceeds expectations, the realized ERP could be higher. Sensitivity analysis across scenarios is essential."
