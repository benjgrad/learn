The committee uses the Grinold-Kroner model to estimate the expected return on domestic equities. Current data:\n\n- Dividend yield: 2.0%\n- Expected inflation: 2.5%\n- Expected real earnings growth: 1.8%\n- Expected repricing (P/E expansion): -0.5%\n- Expected share repurchases: 1.0%\n\nWhat is the expected nominal equity return?",

            "A) Reverse optimization eliminates the need for any subjective inputs, producing a purely objective allocation",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard mean-variance optimization is highly sensitive to expected return inputs -- small changes can produce dramatically different and often extreme allocations. The Black-Litterman approach begins with equilibrium returns implied by market-cap weights (a neutral, diversified starting point) and then blends in the investor's views. This produces more stable, intuitive allocations. Option A is incorrect because the model still requires subjective views as inputs.

          "options": [
            "A) Regulatory limits on total equity exposure for this type of institution",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Private equity's illiquidity is the primary implementation challenge. Capital calls are unpredictable, distributions are uncertain, and the investor cannot readily sell PE holdings to rebalance. This requires maintaining a liquidity buffer (reducing other allocations) and careful cash flow management. Option A may be relevant in some cases but is not the most universal constraint.

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Resampled MVO (Michaud resampling) generates multiple sets of inputs by resampling from the estimated distribution of returns, then averages the resulting optimal portfolios. This produces more diversified, stable allocations that are less sensitive to any single set of point estimates.

While MVO assumes normality (or at least that investors care only about mean and variance), this does not invalidate the framework.

          "question": "A sovereign wealth fund's liability is denominated in its domestic currency, and its asset allocation includes 40% in foreign equities. The fund is debating whether to hedge the currency exposure. Which factor would most strongly argue against hedging?",
          "options": [
            "A) The domestic currency is a commodity currency that tends to appreciate when global equities decline, providing a natural hedge for the equity allocation",
            "B) The domestic economy is heavily dependent on commodity exports, and the fund's purpose is to diversify away from domestic economic risks",
            "C) Interest rate differentials make hedging costs prohibitively expensive relative to the expected currency return"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "If the domestic currency is a commodity currency that appreciates during global equity downturns (negative correlation between domestic currency strength and foreign equity returns), then the unhedged foreign equity position already benefits from a natural hedge: when foreign equities fall, the depreciation of the foreign currency is offset by the domestic currency appreciation. Hedging would remove this beneficial diversification. Option B argues FOR diversification (and thus for the foreign allocation itself) but does not directly address the hedging question. Option C may argue against hedging but is a cost argument, not a portfolio construction argument about risk reduction.",

          "question": "A tax-exempt university endowment and a taxable private foundation both have $500 million in assets and identical investment objectives. When constructing asset allocations, which statement is most accurate regarding the difference in approach?",
          "options": [
            "A) Both should use identical allocations since they have the same objectives and portfolio size",
            "B) The private foundation's required 5% annual distribution rate and potential investment income taxes create different constraints that may lead to a different optimal allocation",
            "C) The endowment should hold more fixed income because it has greater liquidity needs than the foundation"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Private foundations in the US must distribute at least 5% of assets annually and may be subject to a 1-2% excise tax on net investment income. These constraints affect after-tax return requirements and may favor different asset class weights (e.g., less emphasis on high-yield, dividend-paying investments). Tax-exempt endowments do not face the excise tax, allowing different optimization. Option A ignores important structural differences. Option C reverses the typical relationship -- foundations have the mandatory distribution requirement, creating at least comparable liquidity needs.",

          "question": "An asset allocation committee uses the following framework: 60% of the allocation is determined by long-term strategic targets, 30% by tactical tilts based on 12-month market views, and 10% by short-term opportunistic trades. The committee is reviewing the total allocation to equities, which is currently 5% overweight relative to the strategic target. Which of the following governance concerns is most relevant?",
          "options": [
            "A) The tactical and opportunistic overlays may lack sufficient risk budgeting discipline, allowing the total active risk to exceed the board's tolerance without transparent attribution",
            "B) The 60/30/10 framework is inherently flawed because strategic allocation should always be 100% of the decision",
            "C) The 5% equity overweight is too small to create meaningful risk and should be ignored"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "The key governance concern with layered allocation frameworks (strategic + tactical + opportunistic) is ensuring that the total active risk is properly budgeted and monitored. Without discipline, the tactical and opportunistic overlays can compound, creating unintended concentrations. The board should set explicit risk budgets for each layer and monitor the total deviation. Option B is too dogmatic -- tactical asset allocation is a legitimate practice if properly governed. Option C ignores the potential for the 5% overweight to be just one of many compounding active positions.",

          "question": "A pension fund uses liability-driven investing and splits its portfolio into a liability-hedging portfolio (LHP) and a return-seeking portfolio (RSP). The fund's actuary reports that interest rate sensitivity of liabilities has increased due to falling rates (convexity effect). The LHP currently holds duration-matched government bonds. Which action is most appropriate?",
          "options": [
            "A) No action is needed; the LHP is already duration-matched",
            "B) Extend the duration of the LHP to re-match the increased liability duration, potentially using interest rate derivatives if physical bonds of sufficient duration are unavailable",
            "C) Reduce the RSP allocation and move assets to the LHP without changing the LHP's duration profile"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "When interest rates fall, the convexity of liabilities (which typically have greater convexity than assets due to their long-dated, cash-flow profile) causes liability duration to increase more than asset duration. The LHP's duration match has drifted, leaving the fund exposed to further rate changes. The correct response is to extend LHP duration to re-establish the match. Interest rate swaps or swaptions may be needed if sufficiently long-duration physical bonds are unavailable. Option A ignores the duration drift. Option C addresses the size of the LHP but not the duration mismatch, which is the core problem.",
