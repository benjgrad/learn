The combined portfolio may be suboptimal."

      "question": "An investor who diversified broadly still feels intense regret when one sector they did not overweight performs well. Which bias best explains this?",
      "answer": "Regret aversion \u2014 specifically, regret of omission. The investor regrets not taking an action (overweighting the sector) even though their diversified approach was rational and appropriate. This bias can lead investors to chase performance, deviate from disciplined allocation, and make pro-cyclical bets. The antidote is a pre-commitment to a written investment policy statement that anchors decisions to long-term goals rather than short-term relative performance."

      "title": "Constructed Response: Behavioral Finance Application",
      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Behavioral biases identification:**\n\n1. **Recency bias / Availability**: The client's demand to sell after a market decline is driven by the vivid, recent experience of losses, which makes further losses feel more probable than they actually are.\n\n2. **Loss aversion**: The pain of the recent decline is felt approximately twice as intensely as the pleasure from equivalent past gains. The client is disproportionately motivated to avoid further losses.\n\n3. **Representativeness**: The client may be pattern-matching the current decline to a previous crisis (e.g., 2008) and assuming a similar trajectory, ignoring base rates and different current conditions.\n\n4. **Framing effect**: If the client is viewing returns on a short-term (daily/weekly) basis, the frequency of loss observations triggers myopic loss aversion. The same portfolio viewed annually would show far fewer loss periods.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Advisory response:**\n\n1. **Acknowledge the emotion** \u2014 validate that the discomfort is real and natural (loss aversion is hardwired), then redirect to the plan.\n\n2. **Reframe the time horizon** \u2014 show the portfolio's performance over rolling 5-year and 10-year periods to demonstrate that short-term declines are normal and historically temporary for diversified portfolios.\n\n3. **Reference the IPS** \u2014 remind the client that the current allocation was chosen to achieve their specific long-term goals. Selling now would lock in losses and create a new problem: when to re-enter.\n\n4. **Offer a partial accommodation** \u2014 if the client cannot be reasoned out of the panic, offer a small reduction (5-10%) as a compromise that preserves most of the strategic allocation while giving the client a sense of control. This is better than capitulating entirely.\n\n**Part C \u2014 Structural prevention:**\n\nTo prevent this from recurring, implement:\n- Quarterly (not daily) reporting to reduce myopic loss aversion\n- Automatic rebalancing to remove emotional timing decisions\n- A written escalation protocol in the IPS: \"In the event of a >15% drawdown, the advisor will schedule a review meeting within 5 business days before any changes are implemented\" (cooling-off period)\n- Goals-based reporting that shows progress toward retirement/spending goals rather than mark-to-market portfolio value"
