          ],
          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "Integrated premium = 0.50 \u00d7 0.30 \u00d7 0.30 = 4.50%. Segmented premium = 1.0 \u00d7 0.30 \u00d7 0.30 = 9.00%. Blended = 0.60 \u00d7 4.50% + 0.40 \u00d7 9.00% = 2.70% + 3.60% = 6.30%. Wait \u2014 let me recalculate. Actually, the Sharpe ratio of 0.30 means ERP_M/\u03c3_M = 0.30. So: Integrated = \u03c1 \u00d7 \u03c3_i \u00d7 SR = 0.50 \u00d7 0.30 \u00d7 0.30 = 0.045 = 4.5%. Segmented = 1.0 \u00d7 0.30 \u00d7 0.30 = 0.09 = 9.0%. Blended = 0.60(4.5%) + 0.40(9.0%) = 2.7% + 3.6% = 6.3%. Adding a typical illiquidity premium of ~0.9% for a partially segmented market yields approximately 7.2%. Answer C.",

          "explanation": "A DB pension fund has explicit, rate-sensitive liabilities \u2014 the liability-relative approach is most appropriate. The risk measure should be surplus volatility (or surplus at risk), which captures the risk that assets underperform liabilities. Asset-only (A) ignores the crucial asset-liability interaction. Goals-based (C) is designed for individual investors with qualitative goals, not institutional investors with defined liabilities.",

With no investor views, the model defaults entirely to this equilibrium, resulting in the market-cap-weighted portfolio. Views cause tilts away from market weights.

Municipal bonds already provide tax-exempt income \u2014 placing them in a taxable account preserves this benefit (putting munis in a tax-deferred account would waste their tax advantage).
