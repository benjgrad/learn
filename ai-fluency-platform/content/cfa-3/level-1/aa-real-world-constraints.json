      "solution": "**Part A \u2014 Constraints analysis:**\n\nThe small pension fund ($200M) faces several constraints on the model-recommended 30% PE allocation:\n\n1. **Liquidity constraint**: PE investments have 7-10 year lock-ups. With annual benefit payments of ~$16M (8% of assets), committing $60M to illiquid PE would leave insufficient liquid assets if market downturns reduce the liquid portfolio value while commitments are drawn.\n\n2. **Minimum investment sizes**: Quality PE fund minimum commitments are typically $5-10M. Achieving diversification across vintage years, strategies, and managers at 30% allocation would require ~$60M across 8-12 funds, which may be infeasible.\n\n3. **J-curve effect**: PE commitments are drawn down over 3-5 years and return capital later. The actual allocation to PE will initially be below target and may overshoot later \u2014 the fund cannot precisely control the allocation.\n\n4. **Governance capacity**: PE requires significant due diligence, monitoring, and reporting. A small fund may lack the internal resources to manage a large PE program.\n\n**Part B \u2014 Recommended PE allocation:**\n\nA more appropriate PE allocation would be 10-15% ($20-30M), implemented through:\n- 3-4 diversified fund-of-funds for vintage year diversification\n- Commitment pacing plan (equal commitments over 3-4 years)\n- Maintain liquid reserve equal to unfunded commitments plus 2 years of benefit payments\n\n**Part C \u2014 Rebalancing approach:**\n\nFor this fund, a corridor-based approach is most appropriate:\n- Public equities: \u00b15% corridor (higher volatility \u2192 narrower corridor)\n- Fixed income: \u00b15% corridor\n- PE: Not rebalanced in traditional sense \u2014 use commitment pacing\n- Monitor quarterly but only rebalance when corridors are breached\n- Use futures overlay for capital-efficient rebalancing without liquidating positions (avoids transaction costs and tax consequences)"

Equities generate returns taxed at lower capital gains rates and benefit from deferral of unrealized gains in taxable accounts.

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "An 8% overweight to equities with only 1.5% tracking error budget is almost certainly inconsistent. A large equity overweight in a diversified portfolio would typically generate tracking error well above 1.5% (equities have ~15-20% volatility; an 8% overweight to an asset with that volatility could alone contribute ~1.2-1.6% tracking error). The position size must be calibrated to the risk budget. Option A ignores the risk budget constraint. Option C reflects poor risk management \u2014 TAA positions should be sized to the risk budget, not maximized for impact.",
