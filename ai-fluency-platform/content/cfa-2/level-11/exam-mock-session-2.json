      "vignette": "Priya Sharma, CFA, recently joined Sterling Capital Management as head of equity research. She faces several situations in her first month:\n\nSituation 1: Sharma's predecessor left behind a detailed stock-screening model on the company computer. Sharma wants to use and improve the model for her research. The predecessor did not take a copy when he left and the employment agreement states that all work product belongs to the employer.\n\nSituation 2: A large client, Westbrook Pension, requests that Sterling allocate all their trades through Brokers United, which provides soft-dollar research services to Sterling. The execution quality at Brokers United is adequate but not best-in-class. Brokers United gives Sterling access to a premium research database used across all client accounts.\n\nSituation 3: Sharma discovers that Sterling's marketing materials claim 'Top 5% performance among all equity managers over the past 5 years.' This statistic is based on a now-discontinued strategy that has been merged into the current composite. The current strategy has a different investment process.\n\nSituation 4: Sharma is invited to participate in a stock pitch competition at a university. She plans to present analysis on three stocks she currently covers at Sterling, including specific price targets and trading recommendations.",

            "A) A violation of Standard IV(A) because the model belongs to the predecessor who created it",

The predecessor correctly left the model behind. Sharma, as the new employee authorized by the firm, may use and improve the employer's intellectual property. This is standard practice.

This may not benefit the directing client proportionally. (2) Under Standard III(A), the manager must ensure that soft-dollar arrangements benefit clients. Using Westbrook's directed commissions to fund research for other clients creates a cross-subsidy concern. (3) Execution must be adequate.
