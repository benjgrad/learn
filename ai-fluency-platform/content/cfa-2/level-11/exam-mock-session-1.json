      "vignette": "Linda Alvarez, CFA, is a senior portfolio manager at Pinnacle Asset Management. She manages both institutional and high-net-worth individual accounts. Recently, she has encountered several situations that raise ethical questions.\n\nSituation 1: Alvarez's largest institutional client, a pension fund, asks her to invest 15% of the portfolio in the private real estate fund managed by the pension fund trustee's brother. Alvarez believes the fund has high fees and mediocre performance relative to alternatives.\n\nSituation 2: Alvarez learns from a friend at a pharmaceutical company that the FDA will approve a major drug application next week. The friend told her this at a private dinner, not in any professional capacity. Alvarez holds the pharmaceutical stock in several client accounts.\n\nSituation 3: Alvarez has been asked to present performance results to a prospective client. Her composite includes accounts with varying investment mandates that she has managed over the past three years. One account was terminated after poor performance.\n\nSituation 4: A junior analyst on Alvarez's team has been copying research summaries from a paid subscription service and presenting them as original work in client communications.",
