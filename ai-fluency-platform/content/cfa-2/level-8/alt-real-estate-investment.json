They **exclude** financing costs (mortgage payments), depreciation, and capital expenditures.\n\n### Cap Rate Determinants\n\nThe cap rate reflects the market's required return and growth expectations:\n\n$$R_0 \\approx r - g$$\n\nWhere $r$ is the required return and $g$ is the expected NOI growth rate.\n\n| Factor | Effect on Cap Rate |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| Higher risk | Higher cap rate |\n| Lower growth expectations | Higher cap rate |\n| Better location/quality | Lower cap rate |\n| Strong tenant creditworthiness | Lower cap rate |"

      "answer": "At 6%: Value = $500,000/0.06 = $8.33M. At 5%: Value = $500,000/0.05 = $10.00M. The value increases by $1.67M (20%). Cap rate compression \u2014 a decline in cap rates \u2014 increases property values, similar to how declining yields increase bond prices. Even small cap rate changes have large valuation effects."
