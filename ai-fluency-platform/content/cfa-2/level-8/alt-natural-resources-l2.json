      "question": "A commodity index fund rolls expiring near-month contracts into the next month. If the futures curve is in contango, does this rolling process generate a profit or a loss?",
      "answer": "A loss (negative roll yield). In contango, the next-month contract is priced higher than the expiring contract. The fund sells the cheaper expiring contract and buys the more expensive next-month contract, resulting in fewer contracts held and a drag on returns. This 'roll cost' is a major source of underperformance for passive commodity index funds in persistently contango markets."

Driven by supply/demand fundamentals.\n\n### Roll Yield\nGain or loss from rolling expiring contracts into new ones:\n- **Positive** in backwardation (buy cheaper far contracts, converge to higher spot)\n- **Negative** in contango (buy more expensive far contracts)\n\n### Collateral Yield\nInterest earned on the cash or Treasury securities posted as margin for the futures position. In a fully collateralized strategy, the full notional value earns the risk-free rate.\n\n### Commodity Indices\n\n| Index | Weighting | Roll Method |\n|-------|-----------|-------------|\n| **S&P GSCI** | Production-weighted | Front-month |\n| **Bloomberg Commodity** | Liquidity + production | Diversification rules |\n| **DBIQ Optimum Yield** | Optimized roll | Picks contract on curve to maximize roll yield |\n\nIndex construction significantly affects returns due to different roll methodologies and commodity weightings."

      "title": "A commodity index fund is fully collateralized and invests in crude oil futures. The spot price is $70/barrel, the 1-month futures price is $71.50, the risk-free rate is 4% annually, and over the next month the spot price rises to $72. Calculate the spot return, approximate roll yield, and collateral yield for the month. What is the total return?",
      "solution": "**Spot Return:**\n\n$(72 - 70) / 70 = 2.86\\%$\n\n**Roll Yield (approximate):**\n\nThe fund bought the 1-month future at $71.50, which converges to the spot price of $72 at expiration. The roll yield captures the difference between the futures price paid and where it converges. However, the fund must then buy the next month's contract (assume next-month at similar premium). Monthly roll loss \u2248 $(70 - 71.50)/70 = -2.14\\%$ (buying more expensive futures in contango).\n\n**Collateral Yield:**\n\n$4\\% / 12 = 0.33\\%$ per month\n\n**Total Return:**\n\n$2.86\\% + (-2.14\\%) + 0.33\\% = 1.05\\%$\n\nNote: despite a 2.86% spot gain, the contango roll cost eroded most of the return. This illustrates why passive commodity index returns often lag spot price returns."
