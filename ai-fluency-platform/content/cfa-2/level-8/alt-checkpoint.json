          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "DPI = $180M/$300M = 0.60x. TVPI = ($180M + $250M)/$300M = $430M/$300M = 1.43x. The denominator is paid-in (called) capital ($300M), not committed capital ($500M). Option B incorrectly uses committed capital as the denominator. Option C mixes the correct DPI with the wrong TVPI.",

When rolling, the investor sells the expiring contract (now near spot) and buys the next, more expensive contract. This negative roll yield is a persistent drag on returns for long-only commodity index funds in contango markets. Roll yield exists in both contango (negative) and backwardation (positive).",
