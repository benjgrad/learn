These are made as investment opportunities arise \u2014 LPs do not invest the full commitment upfront.\n\n**Distributions** return capital and profits to LPs through:\n- Exit proceeds from portfolio company sales\n- Dividend recapitalizations\n- IPO proceeds\n\nThe **J-curve effect**: returns are typically negative in early years (management fees and unrealized investments) before turning positive as portfolio companies mature and are exited."

      "question": "A fund has committed capital of $200M, has called $150M, distributed $100M, and the NAV of remaining holdings is $120M. What is the TVPI?",
      "answer": "TVPI = (Distributions + NAV) / Paid-in Capital = ($100M + $120M) / $150M = $220M / $150M = 1.47x. The fund has generated $1.47 for every $1 of capital called, implying a 47% gross return on invested capital. Note: this uses paid-in (called) capital, not committed capital."

Also called the \"cash-on-cash\" return.\n\n$$\\text{RVPI} = \\frac{\\text{NAV of Remaining Holdings}}{\\text{Paid-in Capital}}$$\n\nRVPI measures **unrealized** value still in the fund.\n\n$$\\text{TVPI} = \\text{DPI} + \\text{RVPI} = \\frac{\\text{Distributions + NAV}}{\\text{Paid-in Capital}}$$\n\nTVPI measures **total** value created (realized + unrealized).\n\n### Carried Interest and GP Clawback\n\n**Carried interest** (\"carry\") is the GP's share of profits, typically 20% above a **hurdle rate** (preferred return, often 8%).\n\nTwo distribution methods:\n- **Deal-by-deal (American)**: carry paid on each profitable exit; requires clawback if total fund underperforms\n- **Whole-of-fund (European)**: carry paid only after LPs receive all contributed capital plus the preferred return\n\n**GP clawback**: requires the GP to return excess carry if later losses reduce total returns below the hurdle.

Key features:\n- Provides **liquidity** in an otherwise illiquid asset class\n- Transactions at a **discount or premium** to NAV\n- Growing market allows portfolio rebalancing and early exit\n\n### Co-Investments\n\n**Co-investments** allow LPs to invest directly alongside the GP in specific deals:\n- Lower or no management fees and carry\n- Larger deal exposure\n- Requires LP due diligence capability\n- Potential for adverse selection (GP offers co-invest on less attractive deals)"
