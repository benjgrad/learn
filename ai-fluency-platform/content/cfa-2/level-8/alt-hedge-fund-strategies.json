Managers take long positions in undervalued stocks and short positions in overvalued stocks.\n\n**Key metrics:**\n- **Net exposure** = Long % \u2212 Short % (e.g., 130% long \u2212 50% short = 80% net long)\n- **Gross exposure** = Long % + Short % (e.g., 130% + 50% = 180%)\n- A **market-neutral** fund targets ~0% net exposure\n\n**Return sources:**\n- Alpha from stock selection (long and short)\n- Market beta (proportional to net exposure)\n- Factor tilts (value, size, momentum)\n\n### Dedicated Short Bias\n\nMaintain a persistent net short exposure. Profit from declining stock prices. Historically challenging due to the long-term upward bias of equity markets. Valuable as portfolio diversifiers.\n\n### Equity Market Neutral\n\nEqual long and short dollar (or beta) exposure. Isolates pure stock selection alpha from market direction. Returns are typically lower but more consistent. Sensitive to pair correlations breaking down."

      "answer": "Long P&L: $200M \u00d7 12% = +$24M. Short P&L: $120M \u00d7 (\u22128%) = \u2212$9.6M (shorts lose when the market rises). Net P&L = $24M \u2212 $9.6M = $14.4M. On $200M capital (assuming NAV \u2248 long \u2212 short + cash), return \u2248 $14.4M/$200M \u2248 7.2%. The fund captured upside from longs but the shorts were a drag. The 4% alpha on longs (12% vs 8% market) partially offset by the 2% negative alpha on shorts (8% vs 10% market)."

The \"spread\" narrows as the deal closes.\n\n- **Risk**: deal failure (spread blows out, large loss)\n- **Return profile**: many small gains, occasional large losses (negatively skewed)\n- Sensitive to deal volume and market conditions\n\n### Distressed Securities\n\nInvest in debt or equity of companies in or near bankruptcy. Managers analyze recovery values, capital structure, and reorganization plans.\n\n- Deep fundamental analysis required\n- Illiquid positions with long holding periods\n- Returns driven by restructuring outcomes\n\n### Activist Investing\n\nTake significant ownership stakes and push for changes: board seats, strategic initiatives, capital return, or management changes.\n\n- Concentrated portfolios (high conviction)\n- Long time horizons to realize value\n- Public campaigns vs. private engagement"

This creates vulnerability to liquidity crises (LTCM is the cautionary tale).\n\n### Global Macro\n\n- **Discretionary**: top-down views on currencies, rates, commodities, equities (e.g., Soros's GBP trade)\n- **Systematic**: quantitative models, trend-following, carry trades\n- Highly flexible: can go long or short any asset class globally\n- Often most profitable during periods of market dislocation\n\n### Multi-Strategy and Fund of Funds\n\n**Multi-strategy**: single firm allocates capital across multiple strategies internally. Faster capital reallocation, single layer of fees.\n\n**Fund of funds (FoF)**: invests in multiple hedge funds. Provides diversification and manager selection expertise but adds a second layer of fees (\"2 and 20\" on top of underlying fund fees). Due diligence on underlying managers is the core competency."
