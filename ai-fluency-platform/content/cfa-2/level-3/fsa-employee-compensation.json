      "question": "If the discount rate used to calculate the PBO decreases from 5% to 4%, what happens to the funded status of a defined benefit plan, assuming plan assets remain unchanged?",
      "answer": "The funded status deteriorates (becomes more underfunded). A lower discount rate increases the present value of future benefit obligations (PBO rises) because the same future cash flows are discounted at a lower rate. If plan assets are unchanged, the gap widens. This is a key risk \u2014 falling interest rates can significantly worsen pension funded status, creating hidden leverage on the balance sheet."

Key insight: GAAP allows the use of an expected return ($147M) that exceeds the actual return ($126M), effectively reducing reported pension expense. The $21M difference (expected minus actual return) goes to OCI. The actuarial loss ($50M) also goes to OCI under GAAP, not P&L (unless the corridor threshold is breached). Option B might result from using the actual return instead of expected. Option C confuses the actual return on plan assets with pension expense.",
