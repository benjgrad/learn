      "question": "A Japanese subsidiary of a US parent earns all revenue in yen, pays expenses in yen, and retains most cash locally. Is its functional currency the yen or the dollar?",
      "answer": "The functional currency is the yen (local currency). All indicators point to the local currency: local revenue, local expenses, and local cash retention. The subsidiary operates autonomously in the Japanese economy. Therefore, the current rate method would be used to translate the subsidiary's financial statements into USD for consolidation."
