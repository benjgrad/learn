No single metric tells the full story \u2014 the power lies in **triangulation** across multiple data sources.\n\n### The Analysis Process\n\n1. **Understand the business**: Industry dynamics, competitive position, strategy\n2. **Assess accounting quality**: Policies, estimates, reporting quality (from prior module)\n3. **Analyze profitability**: DuPont decomposition, margin analysis, trends\n4. **Evaluate financial position**: Leverage, liquidity, solvency\n5. **Examine cash flows**: Operating, investing, financing patterns\n6. **Develop forecasts**: Revenue, expenses, capital needs\n7. **Perform valuation**: Based on adjusted and forecasted financials\n\n### DuPont Decomposition (5-Factor)\n\n$$\\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{NI}}{\\text{EBT}} \\times \\frac{\\text{EBT}}{\\text{EBIT}} \\times \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Assets}} \\times \\frac{\\text{Assets}}{\\text{Equity}}$$\n\n| Component | Measures |\n|---|---|\n| NI/EBT | Tax burden |\n| EBT/EBIT | Interest burden |\n| EBIT/Revenue | Operating margin |\n| Revenue/Assets | Asset turnover (efficiency) |\n| Assets/Equity | Financial leverage |"

      "question": "Two companies both have 15% ROE. Company A achieves this through high margins (12% net margin) and low leverage (1.5x). Company B uses low margins (3%) and high leverage (5x). Which company's ROE is more sustainable?",
      "answer": "Company A's ROE is more sustainable. Its ROE is driven by genuine profitability (high margins), which is more durable and less risky. Company B relies on aggressive financial leverage (5x), meaning it has significant debt. High leverage amplifies both gains and losses \u2014 in a downturn, Company B's thin margins may be insufficient to cover interest costs, potentially leading to losses or financial distress. Company A has more room to absorb negative shocks. The DuPont decomposition reveals that the same ROE can come from very different risk profiles."

The ROE decline understates the problem because rising leverage partially masks declining profitability."
