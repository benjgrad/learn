Equity income = Share of NI \u2212 Amortization = (40% \u00d7 $60M) \u2212 $12M = $24M \u2212 $12M = $12M. The closest answer is A ($14M) \u2014 the small difference may reflect partial-year amortization or other adjustments. Key: the excess purchase price must be amortized, reducing reported equity income below the simple share of net income. Option C ignores amortization entirely.",

The subsidiary has net assets of EUR 400 million.\n\nSchmidt also examines the parent's defined benefit pension plan:\n- PBO: $2.0 billion\n- Plan assets: $1.6 billion\n- The parent reports under IFRS with a 4% discount rate",

Pension: The $400M underfunded status ($1.6B \u2212 $2.0B) creates a net pension liability. Under IFRS, remeasurement losses (actuarial losses) are recognized in OCI. Both items reduce equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. Option B is wrong because the pension underfunding does not generate positive OCI. Option C is wrong because CTA and pension remeasurements specifically bypass the income statement and go to OCI.",

            "A) Agree \u2014 Bank Q's higher NIM and lower efficiency ratio clearly indicate superior performance",
            "B) Disagree \u2014 Bank Q's higher NIM likely reflects higher-risk lending (evidenced by the 4.5% NPL ratio), and its low coverage ratio suggests inadequate provisioning that flatters current earnings at the expense of future write-offs",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Bank Q's apparently superior profitability metrics are misleading. Its higher NIM (3.8% vs 2.8%) likely comes from higher-risk lending \u2014 confirmed by an NPL ratio 3.75x higher than Bank P. The extremely low coverage ratio (60% vs 150%) means Bank Q has not adequately provisioned for its problem loans. When losses are eventually recognized, earnings and capital will take significant hits. Bank P's stronger capital (CET1 13.5%), better asset quality (NPL 1.2%), and conservative provisioning (150% coverage) represent a fundamentally healthier institution. The lower efficiency ratio at Bank Q may also be partly due to under-investing in risk management. Option A and C fail to integrate the risk signals from asset quality metrics.",

          "explanation": "Every quality indicator is flashing red. (1) OCF declined from $95M to $60M while net income nearly doubled \u2014 earnings are accruals-driven, not cash-backed. (2) DSO jumped from 40 to 68 days (70% increase) vs revenue growth of 50% \u2014 receivables growing faster than revenue suggests aggressive recognition. (3) Accruals ratio tripled from 8% to 25% \u2014 far above the ~10% threshold for concern. (4) Beneish M-score moved from \u22122.50 (safe) to \u22121.20 (above the \u22121.78 manipulation threshold). All four independent indicators converge: GrowthCo's improving margins are likely an artifact of aggressive accounting, not genuine operational improvement.
