      "question": "A bank has $50 billion in earning assets, $45 billion in interest-bearing liabilities, earns 5.5% on assets, and pays 3.0% on liabilities. What is its NIM?",
      "answer": "NIM = (Interest income \u2212 Interest expense) / Average earning assets = ($50B \u00d7 5.5% \u2212 $45B \u00d7 3.0%) / $50B = ($2.75B \u2212 $1.35B) / $50B = $1.40B / $50B = 2.80%. This is within the typical range for a well-managed bank. The spread between earning asset yield (5.5%) and funding cost (3.0%) is 2.5%, but NIM is higher than the simple spread because earning assets exceed interest-bearing liabilities."

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Asset quality is the greatest concern. The NPL ratio of 3.8% is 2.5x the peer average (1.5%), indicating serious loan quality problems. More critically, the coverage ratio (75%) is far below peers (120%), meaning the bank has not adequately provisioned for its problem loans. If NPLs deteriorate further, the bank may need large additional provisions, directly hitting earnings and capital. While CET1 is below peers (Option A), it still exceeds regulatory minimums. The efficiency ratio gap (Option C) is relatively modest and less immediately threatening than inadequate loss coverage on a large NPL portfolio.",

The bank's RWA is $40 billion.",
          "question": "If First Regional pays the special dividend, its CET1 ratio would decline by approximately 125 basis points. Can the bank pay this dividend without breaching combined buffer requirements?",
          "options": [
            "A) Yes, because the post-dividend CET1 of 9.25% exceeds all combined requirements",
            "B) No, because the post-dividend CET1 of 9.25% is below the combined requirement of 8.0%, triggering dividend restrictions",

Since 9.25% > 8.0%, the bank can pay the dividend without breaching buffer requirements. However, the 125bp cushion above the combined requirement is modest, and given the asset quality concerns identified earlier, this dividend may be imprudent from a risk management perspective. Option B incorrectly states 9.25% is below 8.0%. Option C is unnecessary since the buffer is not breached.",

While Insurer Y's combined ratio appears better, three consecutive years of unfavorable reserve development ($300M this year) is a serious red flag. It suggests Y has been systematically under-reserving \u2014 setting initial loss estimates too low, which artificially inflates current-year underwriting profitability. When reserves prove inadequate, losses are recognized later. Insurer X's favorable development suggests conservative reserving. Option A ignores the reserve development significance.
