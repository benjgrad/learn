      "question": "A company holds a 25% stake in an associate that reports net income of $40 million and pays $10 million in dividends. Under the equity method, what is the impact on the investor's income statement and balance sheet?",
      "answer": "Income statement: The investor recognizes its share of the associate's net income = 25% \u00d7 $40M = $10M as 'equity income from associate.' Balance sheet: The investment account increases by $10M (share of income) and decreases by $2.5M (25% \u00d7 $10M dividends received). Net increase in the investment carrying value = $7.5M. Dividends reduce the investment account, not income \u2014 this is a key equity method concept."

Under US GAAP, the **primary beneficiary** of a VIE \u2014 the entity that absorbs the majority of expected losses or receives the majority of expected residual returns \u2014 must consolidate the VIE. This prevents off-balance-sheet financing abuse.\n\n### IFRS vs GAAP Key Differences\n\n| Topic | IFRS | US GAAP |\n|---|---|---|\n| Equity method \u2014 associate losses | Stop at zero; resume when share of profits exceed unrecognized losses | Same general treatment |\n| Goodwill impairment | One-step (compare recoverable amount to carrying amount) | Two-step for reporting units (ASU 2017-04 simplified to one-step optional) |\n| Classification of debt investments | Business model + cash flow characteristics (IFRS 9) | Three categories: trading, AFS, HTM (ASC 320) |\n| OCI recycling for equity FVOCI | No recycling to P&L (IFRS) | Not available as classification |"
