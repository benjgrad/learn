      "answer": "Company A likely has higher earnings quality. Its operating cash flow exceeds net income, indicating that earnings are well-supported by actual cash generation (negative accruals \u2014 cash exceeds reported earnings). Company B's cash flow is only 40% of reported income, suggesting large positive accruals \u2014 the gap of $60M represents non-cash income recognition that may not be sustainable. This divergence between income and cash flow is a classic red flag."

Net income doubled while OCF declined \u2014 classic accruals-driven earnings.\n\n2. **DSO explosion**: From 58 to 95 days \u2014 a 64% increase. If customers were truly buying more, collection periods shouldn't lengthen this dramatically. Suggests channel stuffing or aggressive revenue recognition.\n\n3. **Capitalized software costs**: Grew from $10M to $55M (450% increase) while revenue grew only 50%. This could be reclassifying operating expenses as capital expenditures to inflate current earnings.\n\n4. **DSRI for Beneish**: Year 3 vs Year 2 = (195/750) / (120/600) = 0.260/0.200 = 1.30 \u2014 above 1.0 indicates potential revenue manipulation.\n\nConclusion: Multiple converging red flags suggest aggressive accounting. An analyst should investigate revenue recognition policies, the nature of capitalized costs, and customer concentration before relying on reported earnings."
