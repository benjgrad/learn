      "question": "A company has a P/E of 25 and its industry average is 18. An intern concludes it is 'overvalued by 39%.' What is wrong with this analysis?",
      "answer": "A higher P/E does not automatically mean overvaluation. The company may justify a higher multiple through: (1) faster expected earnings growth, (2) lower risk/beta, (3) higher profit margins or ROE, (4) more conservative accounting policies that depress current earnings but will reverse. The intern is comparing a raw multiple without controlling for fundamentals. A proper analysis would compute the 'justified P/E' from the company's fundamentals: Justified P/E = (1-b)/(r-g) from the Gordon Growth Model. If the justified P/E is 25 or higher, the stock is fairly valued despite being above the industry average."
