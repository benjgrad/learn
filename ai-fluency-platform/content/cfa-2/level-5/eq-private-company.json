      "question": "A private company generates $5M in EBITDA. A comparable public company trades at 8x EV/EBITDA. An analyst values the private company at exactly $40M enterprise value. What has the analyst likely overlooked?",
      "answer": "The analyst has likely overlooked several adjustments needed when applying public multiples to private companies: (1) A discount for lack of marketability (DLOM), typically 15-30%, reflecting the inability to sell private shares on a liquid exchange. (2) Possible adjustments for excess owner compensation or personal expenses run through the company (normalization). (3) A size premium \u2014 smaller private companies are riskier than their larger public peers. (4) A control premium or minority discount depending on what stake is being valued. After these adjustments, the value would likely be significantly below $40M."

      "content": "## The Three Valuation Approaches\n\n### 1. Income Approach\n\n**Capitalized Cash Flow Method** (for stable companies):\n\n$$V_0 = \\frac{CF_1}{r - g}$$\n\nWhere $CF_1$ is normalized free cash flow, $r$ is the required return (often built up from risk-free rate + equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium), and $g$ is the sustainable growth rate.\n\n**Excess Earnings Method:**\n1. Determine fair return on tangible assets: Working capital return + Fixed asset return\n2. Total earnings - Return on tangible assets = **Excess earnings** (attributable to intangibles)\n3. Capitalize excess earnings at a higher rate (intangibles are riskier)\n4. Value = Tangible asset value + Capitalized excess earnings\n\n### 2. Market Approach\n\n**Guideline Public Company Method:**\n- Identify comparable public companies\n- Apply their multiples (adjusted for size, growth, risk) to the private company's metrics\n- Apply DLOM and other appropriate discounts\n\n**Guideline Transactions Method:**\n- Use multiples from actual private company transactions (M&A deals)\n- Advantage: already reflects private company characteristics\n- Challenge: limited data, stale transactions"

Studies suggest DLOM ranges from **15% to 35%** depending on:\n- Company size and financial health\n- Dividend policy (higher dividends reduce DLOM)\n- Prospects for an IPO or sale\n- Shareholder agreements (put rights reduce DLOM)\n\n### Discount for Lack of Control (DLOC)\n\nMinority shareholders cannot influence corporate decisions:\n\n$$DLOC = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\text{Control premium}}$$\n\nIf the control premium is 25%: $DLOC = 1 - 1/1.25 = 20\\%$\n\n### Control Premium\n\nApplied when valuing a **controlling interest** \u2014 reflects the buyer's ability to:\n- Set dividends and compensation\n- Direct strategy and capital allocation\n- Sell or liquidate the company\n\n### Applying Multiple Discounts\n\nFor a **minority, non-marketable interest**:\n\n$$V_{\\text{minority, illiquid}} = V_{\\text{control}} \\times (1 - DLOC) \\times (1 - DLOM)$$\n\n### Earnouts\n\nAn **earnout** is a contingent payment in an acquisition that depends on the target achieving specified performance targets post-acquisition. This:\n- Bridges valuation gaps between buyer and seller\n- Aligns incentives for the seller to continue contributing\n- Shifts risk to the seller if projections don't materialize\n- Creates potential disputes about target measurement"
