      "question": "A firm has FCFF of $50M, after-tax interest of $12M, and raised $8M in new debt. What is FCFE? Why might FCFE differ substantially from dividends paid?",
      "answer": "FCFE = FCFF - Int(1-t) + Net borrowing = $50M - $12M + $8M = $46M. FCFE often differs from actual dividends because: (1) companies may retain cash for future investment or as a buffer, (2) management may smooth dividends rather than matching them to volatile FCFE, (3) share repurchases are an alternative to dividends, and (4) companies may pay dividends from reserves during periods of low FCFE. FCFE represents what the firm *could* pay to equity holders, not what it actually distributes."
