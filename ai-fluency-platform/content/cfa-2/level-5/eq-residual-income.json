      "question": "A firm has ROE of 12% and cost of equity of 12%. Its book value per share is $40. What is the justified market price using the residual income framework?",
      "answer": "If ROE exactly equals the cost of equity, residual income is zero in every period: RI = (12% - 12%) \u00d7 $40 = $0. The present value of all future residual income is therefore zero, and the stock's justified price equals its book value: V\u2080 = B\u2080 + PV(future RI) = $40 + $0 = $40. This is consistent with the justified P/B formula: P/B = (ROE - g)/(r - g). When ROE = r, P/B = 1 regardless of the growth rate, so P = B = $40."
