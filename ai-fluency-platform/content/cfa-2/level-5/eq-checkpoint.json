You should be able to:\n\n- Select the appropriate valuation model for a given company\n- Calculate intrinsic value using DDM, FCF, market multiples, and residual income\n- Interpret PVGO, justified multiples, and sum-of-the-parts analysis\n- Apply private company valuation adjustments (DLOM, DLOC, normalization)\n- Evaluate sensitivity of valuations to key assumptions"

However, some argue that public company multiples already reflect minority value, so a control premium should be added: $88M \u00d7 (1 + 0.20) = $105.6M. \n\nBut wait \u2014 for a controlling, marketable interest, DLOM typically doesn't apply (the buyer has control to force liquidity). The answer depends on interpretation. If public multiples reflect minority value: $88M \u00d7 1.20 = $105.6M. If public multiples already reflect some control elements, the equity value without adjustments is $88M.\n\nOption C ($88M) represents the equity value before control/discount adjustments, derived directly from the public comparable method. For a 100% acquisition where the buyer IS the control party, the $88M base EV-derived equity is the closest answer. DLOM doesn't apply to a controlling interest that is being acquired for cash.",

Small changes in the terminal growth rate (e.g., 5% vs 6%) cause disproportionately large changes in the terminal value, which dominates the valuation. This is amplified by the high cost of equity denominator. Option A is incorrect \u2014 the FCFE model isn't inherently less reliable; the issue is the specific company characteristics. Option C is incorrect \u2014 FCFE (free cash flow to equity) is the cash flow being discounted, not dividends; the company generates positive FCFE even without paying dividends.",
