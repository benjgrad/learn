But the analyst must consider whether the difference reflects genuine mispricing or estimation error in the model.\n\n### Going Concern vs Liquidation Value\n\n- **Going concern value**: Value assuming the company continues operating \u2014 typically uses discounted cash flow or earnings multiples\n- **Liquidation value**: Value if the company's assets are sold off piecemeal \u2014 sets a **floor** on value. If liquidation value > going concern value, the firm is worth more dead than alive"

      "question": "An analyst estimates a stock's intrinsic value at $45, but it trades at $48. She reports it as 'fairly valued' rather than 'overvalued.' What might justify this?",
      "answer": "The $3 difference (about 6.7%) may fall within the analyst's margin of error or confidence interval. All valuation models involve estimation uncertainty \u2014 input assumptions for growth rates, discount rates, and margins create a range of plausible values. If $45 is a point estimate within a range of, say, $42\u2013$50, then $48 falls within reasonable bounds. Responsible analysts acknowledge this uncertainty rather than treating point estimates as precise."
