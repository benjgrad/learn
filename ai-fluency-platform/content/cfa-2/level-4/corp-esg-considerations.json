      "content": "## ESG Integration Approaches\n\nESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors are increasingly material to investment analysis. Integration approaches range from passive screening to active engagement.\n\n### Integration Spectrum\n\n| Approach | Description | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Negative/exclusionary screening** | Exclude sectors or companies that violate criteria | No tobacco, weapons, fossil fuels |\n| **Positive/best-in-class screening** | Invest in ESG leaders within each sector | Top-quartile ESG scores per industry |\n| **ESG integration** | Systematically include ESG factors in financial analysis | Adjust DCF assumptions for climate risk |\n| **Thematic investing** | Focus on specific ESG themes | Clean energy, water scarcity, gender diversity |\n| **Impact investing** | Target measurable social/environmental outcomes alongside financial returns | Microfinance, affordable housing |\n| **Active ownership/engagement** | Use shareholder rights to influence corporate behavior | Proxy voting, direct engagement with management |\n\n### How ESG Affects Valuation\n\nESG factors can affect valuation through:\n- **Revenue**: consumer preferences, regulatory requirements, market access\n- **Costs**: resource efficiency, waste reduction, employee productivity\n- **Risk premium**: lower ESG risk \u2192 lower cost of capital (both debt and equity)\n- **Asset values**: stranded assets (fossil fuel reserves), environmental liabilities\n- **Growth opportunities**: green products, sustainable markets"

      "question": "A coal mining company has a low ESG score but trades at a high dividend yield of 12%. Does the high yield indicate the stock is undervalued?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. The high dividend yield likely reflects a high risk premium \u2014 the market is pricing in elevated risks including regulatory risk (carbon taxes, mine closures), stranded asset risk (coal reserves may become uneconomic), declining demand, environmental liabilities (cleanup costs), and social license to operate risks. The high yield may actually indicate the stock is fairly valued or even overvalued given the risks. A low ESG score in a declining industry often signals higher cost of equity and declining terminal value, not a value opportunity."

      "content": "## Materiality Assessment and ESG Data\n\n### Materiality\n\n**Financial materiality**: ESG issues that are reasonably likely to affect a company's financial condition or operating performance. Materiality varies by industry:\n\n| Industry | Likely Material ESG Issues |\n|---|---|\n| Oil & Gas | Carbon emissions, spill risk, reserves transition, community relations |\n| Technology | Data privacy, cybersecurity, labor practices, supply chain ethics |\n| Banking | Governance, lending practices, financial inclusion, AML compliance |\n| Retail | Supply chain labor, packaging waste, product safety |\n| Pharma | Drug pricing, clinical trial ethics, product safety, access to medicine |\n\n### ESG Ratings and Data Providers\n\nMajor ESG rating agencies include MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, S&P Global ESG, ISS ESG, and CDP.\n\n**Key challenges with ESG data:**\n- **Low correlation** between different raters (as low as 0.4-0.6 vs ~0.99 for credit ratings)\n- Different methodologies, weightings, and scopes\n- **Self-reported data** without standardized audit requirements\n- **Backward-looking**: ratings reflect past performance, not future trajectory\n- **Size bias**: larger companies score better (more resources for reporting)\n\n### Greenwashing\n\nGreenwashing occurs when companies or funds overstate their ESG credentials. Red flags:\n- Vague commitments without measurable targets\n- Highlighting minor green initiatives while ignoring core business impacts\n- ESG fund labels with minimal actual screening\n- Net-zero pledges relying on unproven offsets"

      "solution": "You are valuing two utility companies using a DCF model:\n\nUtility A: Traditional coal-heavy generation (70% coal)\n- Current FCFE: $500M\n- ESG risk: High carbon exposure, pending regulations\n\nUtility B: Transitioning to renewables (40% coal, declining)\n- Current FCFE: $450M\n- ESG risk: Moderate and improving\n\nESG-adjusted DCF considerations:\n\n1. Cost of equity adjustment:\n- Utility A: Add 150bp ESG risk premium \u2192 r_e = 10.5%\n- Utility B: Add 50bp ESG risk premium \u2192 r_e = 9.5%\n\n2. Growth rate adjustment:\n- Utility A: Potential carbon tax of $50/ton \u2192 FCFE decline of $80M/year within 5 years\n- Utility B: Renewable transition creates growth opportunity \u2192 higher terminal growth\n\n3. Stranded asset risk:\n- Utility A: Coal plants may require early retirement ($2B write-down risk)\n- Utility B: Renewable assets have longer useful lives\n\n4. Terminal value:\n- Utility A: Lower terminal growth (1%) given declining industry relevance\n- Utility B: Higher terminal growth (2.5%) given renewable tailwinds\n\nDespite Utility A's higher current FCFE, the ESG-adjusted DCF may show Utility B is worth more, because lower risk premium, higher growth, and no stranded asset risk create a significantly higher present value of future cash flows."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "ESG ratings from different providers frequently disagree (correlations of 0.4-0.6) because they use different methodologies, scopes, and weightings. Provider X may emphasize governance (where ChemCorp excels), while Provider Z may weight environmental impact heavily (where ChemCorp lags). Averaging would create a meaningless composite that hides these material disagreements. The correct approach is to understand each methodology, identify which factors are financially material for the chemical industry (likely environmental risk, safety, regulatory exposure), and form an independent judgment. Option A treats ESG ratings like credit ratings, which have much higher inter-rater agreement. Option C arbitrarily assumes one provider is superior.",

(4) Fossil fuel holdings contradict the sustainability marketing message. (5) Short-term incentive structure is inconsistent with long-term ESG goals. This is a fund capitalizing on ESG demand without substantive ESG integration. Option A is too charitable given the evidence.
