      "content": "## Dividend Theories\n\nThree competing theories explain whether dividend policy affects firm value:\n\n### Modigliani-Miller (MM) Dividend Irrelevance\n\nIn a perfect market (no taxes, no transaction costs, no asymmetric information), dividend policy is **irrelevant** to firm value. Investors can create their own \"dividend\" by selling shares (homemade dividends). The value of the firm depends only on its investment decisions, not how it distributes cash.\n\n### Bird-in-Hand Theory (Gordon/Lintner)\n\nInvestors prefer dividends to capital gains because dividends are **certain** while capital gains are uncertain. Therefore, higher dividend payout \u2192 lower required return \u2192 **higher** stock price.\n\n$$r_e = \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g$$\n\nIf investors discount uncertain capital gains more heavily, the required return $r_e$ is lower for high-payout firms.\n\n### Tax Preference Theory\n\nIf capital gains are taxed at **lower rates** than dividends (or deferred until realization), investors prefer companies that retain earnings and generate capital gains. Lower dividend payout \u2192 **higher** after-tax return \u2192 higher stock price.\n\n| Theory | Optimal Payout | Logic |\n|---|---|---|\n| MM Irrelevance | Doesn't matter | Perfect markets; homemade dividends |\n| Bird-in-Hand | High payout | Certainty of dividends valued |\n| Tax Preference | Low payout | Capital gains tax advantage |"

      "question": "If the tax rate on dividends equals the tax rate on capital gains, does the tax preference theory still favor low payout?",
      "answer": "Yes, but to a lesser degree. Even with equal tax rates, capital gains taxes are deferred until shares are sold, creating a timing advantage. The present value of deferred taxes is lower than the present value of immediate taxes on dividends. However, the tax preference argument is weaker when rates are equal. In jurisdictions where dividends are taxed at preferential rates (e.g., qualified dividends in the US), the analysis is further nuanced."
