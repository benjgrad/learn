For simplicity: the tax on the repurchase transaction = ($70 - $60)/$70 x $10 x 15% = capital gain portion taxed. Actually, in a repurchase, the investor sells shares: proceeds = $70, cost basis = $60, gain = $10, tax = $10 x 15% = $1.50. After-tax proceeds = $70 - $1.50 = $68.50 from selling one share worth $70. Comparing on the $10 distribution: Dividend after-tax = $7.00.

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "The equity investors put in $300M and received $1,800M - $700M (debt repayment, though already paid down in the problem -- assuming $700M repaid) = $1,100M at exit. Actually, if all debt is repaid at exit: equity value = $1,800M - $0 debt = $1,800M. But debt was $700M, already repaid, so the fund gets $1,800M - (debt outstanding at exit). If debt is fully repaid by exit, equity = $1,800M. Wait -- the equity invested $300M and gets $1,800M back (since debt is repaid). IRR: $300M x (1+r)^5 = $1,800M. $(1+r)^5 = 6.0$. $r = 6.0^{0.2} - 1 = 1.431 - 1 = 43.1\\%$. This demonstrates the leverage effect on equity returns. Option A uses total investment instead of equity. Option C may use a different exit value assumption.",
