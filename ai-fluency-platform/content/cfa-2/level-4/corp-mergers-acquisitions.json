In practice, **50-70% of acquisitions fail to deliver projected synergies** due to integration challenges, cultural conflicts, and overpayment."

      "question": "Company A (P/E = 20x) acquires Company B (P/E = 10x) in an all-stock deal. After the merger, the combined company's EPS increases. Has value been created?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. This is EPS bootstrapping \u2014 a mechanical increase in EPS when a high-P/E acquirer buys a low-P/E target with stock. The combined EPS rises simply because the target's earnings are being valued at a lower multiple. No real economic value has been created unless there are genuine synergies. The market should see through this \u2014 the combined P/E should adjust downward to reflect the blended growth expectations, keeping the stock price approximately unchanged. Analysts should focus on whether NPV-positive synergies exist, not whether EPS increases mechanically."
