      "content": "## Divestitures and Restructuring Transactions\n\nCorporate restructuring involves changing the composition or structure of a company's assets, liabilities, or equity. The goal is typically to **unlock value** that is obscured or destroyed by the current corporate structure.\n\n### Types of Restructuring Transactions\n\n| Transaction | Description | Parent Receives | Result |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Divestiture (asset sale)** | Sell a division/subsidiary to a third party | Cash or securities | Division becomes part of buyer |\n| **Spin-off** | Distribute shares of a subsidiary to existing shareholders pro-rata | Nothing (shares go to shareholders) | Two independent public companies |\n| **Split-off** | Shareholders exchange parent shares for subsidiary shares | Retirement of parent shares | Two companies; parent share count reduced |\n| **Equity carve-out (IPO)** | Sell a minority stake in a subsidiary via IPO | Cash from IPO proceeds | Subsidiary partially public; parent retains control |\n| **Tracking stock** | Issue shares that track a division's performance | Cash from issuance | Single legal entity, separate equity |\n\n### Why Restructure?\n\n- **Conglomerate discount**: Diversified companies often trade below the sum of their parts\n- **Improved focus**: Management attention concentrated on core operations\n- **Better capital allocation**: Each entity has its own capital structure appropriate to its risk\n- **Transparency**: Investors can value businesses separately\n- **Regulatory/antitrust**: Required divestiture as condition of merger approval\n- **Tax efficiency**: Spin-offs can be tax-free to shareholders (if meeting IRS requirements)"

      "question": "A conglomerate trades at an enterprise value of $20 billion. Analysts estimate its consumer division is worth $12 billion and its industrial division is worth $10 billion as standalone entities. What is the conglomerate discount and what might cause it?",
      "answer": "Conglomerate discount = (Sum of parts \u2212 Current EV) / Sum of parts = ($22B \u2212 $20B) / $22B = 9.1%. Causes include: (1) cross-subsidization \u2014 profitable divisions may fund underperforming ones; (2) complexity discount \u2014 investors struggle to value diverse businesses; (3) agency costs \u2014 management may resist divesting even when it creates value; (4) suboptimal capital allocation \u2014 a single capital structure may not suit businesses with different risk profiles. A spin-off or divestiture could unlock the $2B gap."

Secured creditors (to extent of collateral value)\n2. DIP financing\n3. Administrative claims (legal fees, operational expenses during bankruptcy)\n4. Unsecured creditors (bondholders, suppliers)\n5. Subordinated debt\n6. Preferred stockholders\n7. Common stockholders (usually receive nothing)\n\n### Prepackaged Bankruptcy\n\nA **pre-negotiated** restructuring plan agreed upon by the debtor and major creditors **before** filing. Benefits:\n- **Speed**: Weeks vs. months/years for traditional Chapter 11\n- **Cost**: Lower legal and administrative expenses\n- **Less disruption**: Business continues more normally\n- **Creditor certainty**: Terms already agreed\n- Requires support from a supermajority of each creditor class"

Possible explanations:\n- Market skepticism about management quality\n- Cross-subsidization destroying value\n- Comparable multiples may be too generous\n\nStep 3: Restructuring options\n- Spin-off Technology (highest multiple, most distinct from other divisions)\n- Sell Industrial to a strategic buyer (may command premium above public market multiple)\n- Retain Healthcare as core business\n\nPotential value unlocked: Even if only 50% of the SOTP gap is captured, shareholders gain ~$8.6 billion."

At a typical 8-10x multiple: overhead value reduction \u2248 $4-5B. Adjusted SOTP \u2248 $40.4-41.4B. Discount = ($45.4B \u2212 $30B) / $45.4B = 33.9%, or using adjusted: ($40.4B \u2212 $30B) / $40.4B = 25.7%. The answer closest to the raw calculation is C (34%). The CEO's argument about internal capital markets is the classic defense, but empirical evidence generally shows that external capital markets allocate capital more efficiently than conglomerate headquarters. Option A significantly underestimates the discount. Option B is close to the overhead-adjusted figure.",
