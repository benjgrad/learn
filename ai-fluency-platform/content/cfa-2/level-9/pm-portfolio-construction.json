      "answer": "The global market-capitalization-weighted portfolio. Black-Litterman starts from the equilibrium implied by market cap weights (reverse optimization) and only deviates when the manager inputs specific views with a specified confidence level. With zero views, the model defaults to the market portfolio \u2014 a much more sensible starting point than MVO's often extreme solutions. This is one of the model's key advantages."

If a client has a concentrated stock position, the completion portfolio diversifies around it.\n\n### Tax-Efficient Management\n\n| Technique | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Tax-loss harvesting** | Realize losses to offset gains |\n| **Holding period management** | Hold >1 year for long-term capital gains rates |\n| **Asset location** | Place tax-inefficient assets in tax-deferred accounts |\n| **Low turnover** | Minimize realization events |\n| **After-tax rebalancing** | Consider tax cost in rebalancing decisions |"

          "explanation": "Risk parity equalizes the risk contribution from each asset class, not the dollar weight. Since equities are much more volatile than bonds, risk parity dramatically reduces equity weights and increases bond weights to equalize risk contributions. Bonds may need to be leveraged to contribute meaningful return. This produces a portfolio heavily weighted toward bonds/fixed income by dollar value but balanced in risk terms.
