Wait: $1.15 \\times 7\\% = 8.05\\%$. $3\\% + 8.05\\% = 11.05\\%$. Alpha = $12\\% - 11.05\\% = 0.95\\%$, closest to A. But the manager's 2% excess return (12% - 10%) is partly explained by the higher beta (1.15 > 1.0). After adjusting for the extra market risk taken, the alpha is only 0.95%. Option B is the raw excess return without beta adjustment. Option C would apply with slightly different numbers.",

          "explanation": "Monte Carlo simulation generates thousands of random scenarios for risk factors, then calculates portfolio values under each scenario. This is particularly valuable for portfolios with non-linear instruments (options, structured products) where parametric VaR's normality assumption fails. It can model complex dependencies, fat tails, and path-dependent instruments. Option A describes parametric VaR, which is simpler but less flexible. Option C is incorrect -- Monte Carlo introduces its own model risk through the choice of distributions and correlations.",
