This is a good IR, suggesting the manager adds value after accounting for constraints. Without constraints (TC = 1), IR would be 1.00 (option C).

CVaR = $7.5M means that on days in the worst 5% of outcomes, the average loss is $7.5M. Option A confuses CVaR with VaR. Option C incorrectly adds VaR and CVaR. The CVaR/VaR ratio of 1.5 indicates meaningfully worse losses beyond the VaR threshold.",
