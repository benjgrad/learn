      "question": "A stock has a Fama-French three-factor regression with market beta = 1.2, SMB loading = 0.5, HML loading = \u22120.3. Is this stock more likely a large-cap growth stock or a small-cap value stock?",
      "answer": "Large-cap growth stock. A negative HML loading (\u22120.3) means the stock behaves like a growth stock (low book-to-market). The positive SMB loading (0.5) initially suggests small-cap, but the loading is moderate. However, the key distinction: negative HML = growth orientation. A pure small-cap value stock would have positive SMB AND positive HML. The combination of negative HML with moderate SMB suggests mid-cap growth or a large-cap growth stock with some small-cap exposure."
