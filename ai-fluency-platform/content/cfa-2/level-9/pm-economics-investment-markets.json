Understanding these patterns is essential for tactical allocation.\n\n| Cycle Phase | Economy | Equities | Bonds | Credit Spreads | Commodities |\n|------------|---------|----------|-------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Early Expansion** | Recovery from trough | Strong (\u2191\u2191) | Moderate (\u2191) | Narrowing | Rising |\n| **Late Expansion** | Overheating, inflation | Moderate (\u2191) | Weak (\u2193) | Narrow (tight) | Strong (\u2191\u2191) |\n| **Early Contraction** | Slowdown begins | Weak (\u2193\u2193) | Strong (\u2191) | Widening | Falling |\n| **Late Contraction** | Near trough | Recovering | Strong (\u2191\u2191) | Wide (peak) | Weak |\n\n### Key Relationships\n\n- **Equities** lead the cycle: they typically bottom before the economy and peak before it\n- **Government bonds** rally when rates fall (contraction) and decline when rates rise (expansion)\n- **Credit spreads** are countercyclical: they widen in contractions as default risk rises\n- **Commodities** track real economic activity and inflation expectations"

      "question": "The Taylor rule suggests a policy rate of 4.5%, but the central bank has set the rate at 3.0%. Is monetary policy accommodative or restrictive, and what are the likely implications for asset prices?",
      "answer": "Monetary policy is accommodative (the actual rate is below the Taylor rule prescription). This stimulates economic activity by making borrowing cheaper. Implications: supports equity valuations through lower discount rates and credit availability, compresses credit spreads, may encourage risk-taking, but increases inflation risk. If the central bank is behind the curve, it may need to raise rates aggressively later, which could disrupt markets."

It includes both expected inflation and an **inflation risk premium**.\n\n- Rising BEI \u2192 market expects higher inflation (or demands more inflation protection)\n- Falling BEI \u2192 market expects lower inflation or deflation risk\n\n### Yield Curve Factors\n\nThe yield curve is driven by three primary factors:\n\n1. **Level** (parallel shift): explains ~90% of yield curve movements; all rates move up or down together\n2. **Slope** (steepening/flattening): short and long rates move differently; driven by growth and policy expectations\n3. **Curvature** (butterfly): intermediate rates move relative to short and long ends; less economically intuitive"

The central bank is significantly behind the curve.\n\n**Implications for Bond Investors:**\n- The central bank will likely need to raise rates substantially, causing bond prices to fall\n- Short-duration positioning is defensive\n- Break-even inflation may rise further, favoring TIPS over nominal bonds\n- Credit spreads may initially benefit from accommodative policy but face risk when tightening begins abruptly"
