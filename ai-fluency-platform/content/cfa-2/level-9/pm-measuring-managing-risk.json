Apply each of the last $N$ historical daily returns to the current portfolio\n2. Sort the resulting P&L from worst to best\n3. The VaR is the loss at the $\\alpha$-th percentile\n\n**Advantages**: no distributional assumption, captures fat tails and correlations naturally\n**Disadvantages**: assumes past represents future, limited by historical sample size\n\n### Monte Carlo Simulation VaR\n\n1. Specify a statistical model for risk factors (returns, correlations, volatilities)\n2. Generate thousands of random scenarios\n3. Price the portfolio under each scenario\n4. VaR = loss at the specified percentile\n\n**Advantages**: flexible, handles non-linear positions (options), can model complex dependencies\n**Disadvantages**: computationally intensive, model-dependent"
