When her direct supervisor dismisses the concern, she should escalate to compliance, legal counsel, or senior management. She should also consider whether her continued association constitutes participation in the violation. If the firm fails to act, she may need to dissociate (which could include resignation).

The accidental nature of receipt does not create an exception. James must: (1) not trade, (2) not communicate the information, and (3) notify compliance to place the security on a restricted list.

She must: (1) not trade either security in any account (personal or client), (2) disclose the board position conflict to her employer, (3) have both securities placed on the firm's restricted list.

If a key supporting study has been retracted, the analyst's basis is materially weakened. The analyst has a duty to verify the current status of referenced research and to update the recommendation if the basis changes.

Selectively pre-notifying large clients gives them an unfair advantage to act before smaller clients. The standard does not require simultaneous delivery but prohibits intentional discrimination. Robert should disseminate the change to all clients at the same time. Option B is factually incorrect -- there is no such exception.

Standard I(B) requires maintaining independence and objectivity -- accepting expensive gifts from brokers who benefit from trade flow threatens both. Standard IV(B) requires written consent from the employer before accepting compensation or benefits from third parties.

The CFA designation usage ('Sarah Lee, CFA') is actually correct -- it is used as an adjective/title after the name. If it said 'Sarah Lee, a CFA' or 'CFA Sarah Lee,' that would violate VII(B).

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Standard V(A) requires the analyst to have a reasonable and adequate basis for recommendations. Using a model without understanding its methodology, assumptions, and limitations means the analyst cannot assess whether the output is reasonable. She cannot distinguish valid signals from model errors. Simply disclosing that recommendations are 'model-driven' does not fulfill the duty of diligence.

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "An analyst who participates in the IPO process cannot produce independent, objective research on the same company. The investment banking fee creates a powerful incentive to issue a favorable recommendation. Firewalls (information barriers) between investment banking and research exist specifically to prevent this type of conflict. Even with disclosure, the dual role fundamentally compromises objectivity. Option B underestimates the severity -- disclosure alone is insufficient when objectivity is structurally impossible.

Allocating IPO shares based on fee revenue (benefiting the manager's firm) rather than a predetermined, systematic allocation policy (pro-rata, rotational, or random) discriminates against the smaller client. Both accounts have similar objectives and should have fair access. Option B conflates account size with fair allocation -- size-based allocation is acceptable only as part of a documented pro-rata policy, not fee-based favoritism.

Churning is a violation of securities regulations. The CFA charterholder must take steps to address the misconduct: report through internal channels (compliance, management), refuse to participate, and consider dissociation if the firm does not act.

          "explanation": "Standard VI(B) requires that the employer's and clients' transactions take priority over the member's personal transactions. Running the algorithm personally first allows the analyst to benefit from market impact before the employer's trades, potentially front-running the employer's orders. Employer permission for a personal account does not waive the priority requirement. Option B incorrectly assumes employer permission covers all aspects. Option C partially identifies the issue but VI(B) is the specific, applicable standard.",

If the analyst believes the stock is overvalued but maintains a 'Buy' rating because the firm benefits from the banking relationship, she has compromised her objectivity. The investment banking fee creates a financial incentive that is distorting her published opinion. Disclosure of the relationship (Option C's suggestion) is necessary but insufficient -- the rating itself must reflect the analyst's genuine view.

          "options": [
            "A) She violated Standard IV(A) Loyalty by taking the client list and proprietary models, which are the employer's property, but performance records she personally generated may be acceptable if they do not include confidential client information",

          "explanation": "Under Standard IV(A), members owe loyalty to their employer regarding proprietary information. Client lists and proprietary models developed during employment generally belong to the employer, even if the member created them. Taking these without permission violates the duty of loyalty. Performance records are a grey area -- general performance data that does not reveal client identities may be acceptable, but specific client information is the employer's. Option B ignores the employer's ownership rights over work product. Option C conflates physical materials with memorized information (memory is generally not restricted, but physical copies are).",
