Act with integrity, competence, diligence, and respect\n2. Place client interests above your own\n3. Use reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment\n4. Practice and encourage others to practice professionally and ethically\n5. Promote the integrity and viability of global capital markets\n6. Maintain and improve professional competence\n\n### Key Standards for Level II Focus\n\n| Standard | L2 Focus Area |\n|----------|---------------|\n| I(B) Independence and Objectivity | Research analyst conflicts, IB pressure |\n| I(C) Misrepresentation | Performance presentation, omission of material facts |\n| II(A) Material Nonpublic Information | Mosaic theory application |\n| III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care | Fiduciary duty in complex structures |\n| V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis | Research quality, reliance on third-party research |\n| V(B) Communication with Clients | Fair disclosure, distinguishing fact from opinion |\n| VI(A-B) Conflicts of Interest | Disclosure and priority of transactions |"

      "question": "An analyst receives a draft earnings report from a company's IR team 'for review' before the public release. Can the analyst trade on this information?",
      "answer": "No. The draft earnings report is Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI). Trading on it would violate Standard II(A). The analyst should: (1) not trade or cause others to trade on the information, (2) not communicate the information to others who might trade, (3) attempt to have the company make the information public, and (4) document the receipt of MNPI and notify compliance. Even if the analyst's model already predicted similar results, acting on the confirmed MNPI is a violation."

Sarah's research indicates TechCo is fairly valued at best, but her managing director asks her to raise her price target to support the offering. Sarah's compensation includes a bonus partially tied to investment banking revenue. Identify all ethical issues and describe the appropriate course of action under the CFA Standards.",
      "solution": "**Ethical Issues:**\n\n1. **I(B) Independence and Objectivity**: The MD's request directly pressures Sarah to issue a non-objective recommendation. The IB relationship creates a conflict between honest research and firm revenue.\n\n2. **VI(A) Conflicts of Interest**: Sarah's compensation is tied to IB revenue, creating a personal financial incentive to issue a favorable rating. This conflict must be disclosed.\n\n3. **I(C) Misrepresentation**: Raising the price target without a legitimate analytical basis would misrepresent her professional opinion.\n\n4. **V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis**: A price target change must be supported by analysis, not business relationships.\n\n**Appropriate Actions:**\n\n1. Decline to change the recommendation without an analytical basis\n2. Document the pressure and report it to compliance\n3. If the recommendation is published, include disclosure of the firm's IB relationship with TechCo\n4. Disclose the compensation conflict in the research report\n5. If the firm overrides her recommendation, consider whether to dissociate from the report\n6. If pressures cannot be resolved, consider whether continued employment is compatible with ethical obligations"

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard I(B) requires independence and objectivity. Marcus must issue recommendations based on his honest analysis regardless of the firm's banking relationship. Delaying a rating change to protect the IB relationship (Option A) violates this standard and potentially harms clients who rely on his research. The quiet period for the bond offering restricts the firm from publishing research to promote the offering, but it does not prevent honest downgrade based on new material information (a failed trial).
