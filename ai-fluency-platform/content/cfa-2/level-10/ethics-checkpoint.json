          "question": "**Vignette**: An analyst at a buy-side firm uses client brokerage commissions (soft dollars) to purchase a financial database used for portfolio analysis, a Bloomberg terminal for the investment team, and office renovation costs for the firm's new trading floor. Which expenditure violates the CFA Standards regarding soft dollar arrangements?",
          "options": [
            "A) Financial database",

          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "Office renovation is an administrative/overhead expense that benefits the firm, not the client. It fails the client benefit test required under the Standards. Financial databases and Bloomberg terminals directly support the investment research process that benefits clients. The key principle: soft dollars may only be used for research and services that directly assist in the investment decision-making process.",

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Standard II(A) prohibits trading on material nonpublic information regardless of how it was obtained. The acquisition information is clearly material (would affect the target's stock price) and nonpublic (the executives were discussing it privately, not through a public announcement). Overhearing it accidentally in a restaurant does not make it public information \u2014 it was not disseminated through channels designed to reach the investing public.

Immediately removing the stock (A) could be premature and potentially harmful to clients if the recommendation is still valid; the undisclosed conflict does not necessarily mean the recommendation is wrong. Confronting the analyst directly (C) bypasses proper compliance channels and could allow the analyst to cover up the violation.
