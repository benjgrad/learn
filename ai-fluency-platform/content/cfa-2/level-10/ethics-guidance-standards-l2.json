When local law is stricter, follow local law.\n\n**Complex scenario**: an analyst working in Country A covers companies in Country B, for clients in Country C. Which jurisdiction's laws apply?\n- Follow the **strictest** of: CFA Standards, laws of Country A (where you work), Country B (where the company is), and Country C (where clients are)\n- When in doubt, follow CFA Standards as the baseline\n\n### I(B) Independence and Objectivity \u2014 Gifts and Entertainment\n\n| Acceptable | Problematic |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Modest business lunch | Lavish vacation as incentive to recommend |\n| Industry conference attendance | All-expenses-paid trip from a covered company |\n| Small promotional items | Gifts that could reasonably influence judgment |\n\nThe test is whether the gift or benefit could **reasonably be expected** to compromise objectivity \u2014 not whether it actually does.\n\n### I(D) Misconduct\n\nExtends to conduct outside professional activities if it reflects on professional integrity.

      "question": "A portfolio manager in London manages accounts for clients in Saudi Arabia, where certain short-selling restrictions exist that are stricter than CFA Standards. The manager uses short selling in a global equity strategy. Must the manager comply with Saudi short-selling rules?",
      "answer": "Yes. Standard I(A) requires following the strictest applicable law. Since the clients are in Saudi Arabia and that jurisdiction imposes stricter short-selling restrictions than CFA Standards or UK law, the manager must comply with Saudi rules for those specific client accounts. The manager could still use short selling for other clients not subject to those restrictions. Practically, this may require separate account management or strategy modifications for Saudi clients."

The firm must have a proxy voting policy.\n\n### III(B) Fair Dealing\n\n**IPO allocation**: must be allocated fairly, not favoring accounts that generate the most fees or that belong to the PM's preferred clients. Use a systematic, pre-established allocation policy.\n\n### IV(A) Loyalty to Employer\n\n**Competing activities**: leaving to start a competing firm is permissible, but you cannot solicit clients or take proprietary information before departing. Preparation (forming an entity, renting space) is allowed; solicitation of current clients is not."

Blindly following a model's output is not a 'reasonable basis.'\n\n### V(B) Communication with Clients\n\n- **Distinguish fact from opinion**: clearly label forecasts, estimates, and opinions\n- **Disclose model limitations**: if a recommendation is based on a model, explain key assumptions\n- **Changes in methodology**: notify clients of significant changes\n- **Fair presentation**: include both risks and potential rewards\n\n### VI(B) Priority of Transactions\n\nOrder of priority: **client accounts \u2192 employer accounts \u2192 personal accounts**\n\nThe analyst's personal trades must not front-run or disadvantage client or employer trades. Pre-clearance and holding period requirements are best practice.\n\n### VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute and the CFA Designation\n\n- \"CFA charterholder\" (lowercase 'c', 'h') \u2014 correct as a noun\n- \"Passed all three levels on the first attempt\" \u2014 improper; suggesting superiority\n- Must not claim CFA Institute endorses any product or strategy"

Before resigning, he: (1) copies his client contact list to his personal laptop, (2) informs three of his largest clients he is leaving and invites them to follow him, (3) takes his personal notes on investment ideas he developed while at Acme. Analyze each action against the Standards.",
      "solution": "**Action 1 \u2014 Copying client contact list:**\nVIOLATION of Standard IV(A) Loyalty to Employer. Client lists developed during employment are typically the employer's property. Copying proprietary information before departure is not permissible.\n\n**Action 2 \u2014 Soliciting clients before leaving:**\nVIOLATION of Standard IV(A). While James can inform clients of his departure after he leaves, actively soliciting them to move while still employed is disloyal to his employer. He may not solicit until after his departure, and even then must comply with any non-compete or non-solicitation agreements.\n\n**Action 3 \u2014 Taking personal investment notes:**\nGRAY AREA. If the notes contain proprietary models, research, or strategies developed using the firm's resources, they belong to the employer. If they are purely personal observations and general investment knowledge, they may be James's property. The key test: were the notes created using firm resources and as part of his duties? If so, they are the firm's property.\n\n**Best practice for James:** resign, serve notice period, leave proprietary materials behind, and only contact clients after departure within the bounds of any contractual restrictions."
