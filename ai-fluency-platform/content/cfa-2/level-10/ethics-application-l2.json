Should she: (a) immediately sell the stock for clients, (b) report to compliance first, or (c) contact the company for clarification?",
      "answer": "She should (a) act to protect client interests by trading out of the position promptly and (b) report to compliance simultaneously. Client protection (Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care) takes priority. Since her information comes from public sources (not MNPI), she is not restricted from trading. Waiting for company clarification (c) would delay protecting clients from a known risk. She should document her analysis, execute trades for all affected clients fairly (Standard III(B)), and work with compliance to determine if the fraud should be reported to regulators."
