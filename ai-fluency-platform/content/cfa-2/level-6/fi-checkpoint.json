You should be able to:\n\n- Extract forward rates from the spot curve and interpret their economic meaning\n- Value bonds using binomial trees with backward induction\n- Analyze callable, putable, and convertible bonds using OAS\n- Apply structural and reduced-form credit models\n- Price and interpret CDS contracts and basis trades"
