Wait -- if this is the Year 2 node and the bond matures at Year 3, we need the PV at Year 2 of the Year 3 cash flow: $105/1.065 = $98.59. Since $98.59 < call price of $100, the issuer would NOT call (calling at $100 when the bond is worth $98.59 to the holder would not happen). Actually, the issuer calls when the bond's value exceeds the call price. At $98.59 < $100, no call. Value = $98.59. But the question says 'cash flow value is $105' -- if that means the computed value at the node is $105, then it exceeds the call price and the issuer would call. Value = min($105, $100) = $100.

He is overpaying for protection, so the mark-to-market value of his position is negative (a loss if he wanted to unwind). Conversely, if credit deteriorates, his CDS position gains value.
