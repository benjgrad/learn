      "content": "## Structural Models: The Merton Model\n\nThe **Merton model** (1974) treats a company's equity as a **call option** on the firm's assets, with the debt face value as the strike price.\n\n### Intuition\n\n- Firm assets $A_T$ at debt maturity $T$\n- Debt face value $D$ due at time $T$\n- If $A_T > D$: firm is solvent, equity holders get $A_T - D$, debtholders get $D$\n- If $A_T < D$: firm defaults, debtholders get $A_T$, equity holders get 0\n\nThis is exactly the payoff of a **European call option**:\n\n$$E_T = \\max(A_T - D, 0)$$\n\nAnd the debt value is:\n\n$$D_T = D - \\max(D - A_T, 0)$$\n\nDebt holders are effectively long a risk-free bond and **short a put option** on the firm's assets. The credit spread compensates for this embedded short put.\n\n### Key Inputs\n\n| Input | Description |\n|---|---|\n| $A_0$ | Current market value of assets |\n| $\\sigma_A$ | Volatility of asset value |\n| $D$ | Face value of debt |\n| $T$ | Time to debt maturity |\n| $r$ | Risk-free rate |\n\n### Distance to Default\n\n$$DD = \\frac{\\ln(A_0/D) + (\\mu - \\sigma_A^2/2)T}{\\sigma_A \\sqrt{T}}$$\n\nHigher DD means lower default probability. The probability of default is $N(-DD)$ where $N$ is the cumulative normal distribution."

      "question": "Using the Merton model, which of these two companies has higher default risk? Company A: assets = $200M, debt = $120M, asset volatility = 25%. Company B: assets = $200M, debt = $180M, asset volatility = 15%.",
      "answer": "Company B has higher default risk despite lower asset volatility. Company A has an asset-to-debt ratio of 1.67x with 25% volatility, while Company B has a much tighter ratio of 1.11x with 15% volatility. The key metric is the distance to default \u2014 Company B's assets only need to decline by ~11% to hit the default boundary, while Company A's need to fall by ~40%. Even though Company B's assets are less volatile, the small cushion above the debt level makes default much more likely. The Merton model captures this through DD: a higher debt-to-asset ratio reduces DD significantly, while the effect of lower volatility only partially offsets this."
