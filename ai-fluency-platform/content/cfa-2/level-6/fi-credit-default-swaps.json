      "question": "A CDS on Company X has a spread of 300 bps on a notional of $10M. The protection buyer has been paying for 2 years, and then Company X defaults. Recovery rate is 40%. What are the total premiums paid, and what is the payout?",
      "answer": "Premiums paid: 300 bps \u00d7 $10M \u00d7 2 years = 0.03 \u00d7 $10M \u00d7 2 = $600,000 total. Payout upon default: (1 - Recovery rate) \u00d7 Notional = (1 - 0.40) \u00d7 $10M = $6,000,000 (cash settlement). The protection buyer paid $600K and received $6M \u2014 a net gain of $5.4M. This illustrates why CDS can provide highly leveraged credit exposure: the annual premium is small relative to the potential payout. The protection seller collected $600K but now owes $6M \u2014 they bear the actual credit loss."
