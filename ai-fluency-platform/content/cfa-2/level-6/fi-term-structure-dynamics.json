The **spot rate curve** (or zero curve) plots these rates across maturities.\n\nThe price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time $T$:\n\n$$P_T = \\frac{100}{(1+z_T)^T}$$\n\nA coupon bond can be viewed as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, each priced at the corresponding spot rate:\n\n$$P = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{C}{(1+z_t)^t} + \\frac{100}{(1+z_T)^T}$$\n\n### Why Spot Rates Matter\n\n- YTM assumes a flat term structure \u2014 spot rates are more precise\n- Spot rates are the building blocks for **no-arbitrage pricing**\n- Two bonds with identical cash flows must have the same price when valued with spot rates\n\n## The Forward Rate Model\n\nThe **implied forward rate** $f(j,k)$ is the rate from time $j$ to time $j+k$ implied by today's spot curve:\n\n$$(1+z_{j+k})^{j+k} = (1+z_j)^j \\times (1+f(j,k))^k$$\n\nSolving for the 1-year forward rate 1 year from now:\n\n$$f(1,1) = \\frac{(1+z_2)^2}{(1+z_1)} - 1$$\n\n### Example\n\n$z_1 = 3\\%$, $z_2 = 4\\%$:\n\n$$f(1,1) = \\frac{(1.04)^2}{1.03} - 1 = \\frac{1.0816}{1.03} - 1 = 5.01\\%$$\n\nThe market implies the 1-year rate will be about 5% next year \u2014 the \"break-even\" rate that makes 1-year and 2-year investments equivalent."

      "answer": "Not necessarily. An upward-sloping spot curve is consistent with expectations of rising rates, but there are alternative explanations: (1) The liquidity preference theory suggests investors demand a term premium for holding longer-duration bonds, making the curve upward-sloping even if rates are expected to stay constant. (2) The preferred habitat theory argues that supply and demand imbalances across maturities shape the curve. (3) The market segmentation theory says different investor groups (pension funds, banks) dominate different maturities. The pure expectations hypothesis would interpret the slope as reflecting expected rate increases, but empirical evidence shows that term premiums are a significant component of the yield curve slope."
