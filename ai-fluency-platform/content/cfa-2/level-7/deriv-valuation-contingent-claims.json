At each node:\n1. Calculate the option value from the two subsequent nodes\n2. For American options, compare this continuation value with the immediate exercise value\n3. The option value at each node is the **greater** of continuation and exercise value\n\n### Key Properties\n- Risk-neutral probabilities are NOT real-world probabilities\n- The model is preference-free: no risk premium is needed\n- As the number of periods $\\to \\infty$, the binomial model converges to BSM\n- American put options may be optimally exercised early (unlike European puts)"

      "answer": "Closer to 60%. $\\pi = (1.03 - 0.87)/(1.15 - 0.87) = 0.16/0.28 = 0.5714 \\approx 57\\%$. The risk-neutral probability is pulled toward the up state because the risk-free rate (3%) is positive \u2014 the stock must have a positive expected return under the risk-neutral measure to prevent arbitrage."
