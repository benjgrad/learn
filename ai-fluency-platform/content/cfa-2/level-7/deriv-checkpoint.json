          "question": "A 6-month equity forward is priced at $52.50. The stock is at $50 with a continuous dividend yield of 1% and the risk-free rate is 5% (continuous). The forward is:",
          "options": [
            "A) Fairly priced",
            "B) Overpriced, creating a cash-and-carry arbitrage opportunity",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "No-arbitrage forward = $50 \u00d7 e^{(0.05\u22120.01)\u00d70.5} = $50 \u00d7 e^{0.02} = $50 \u00d7 1.02020 = $51.01$. The market forward ($52.50) exceeds the theoretical value, so it is overpriced. An arbitrageur would sell the forward at $52.50, borrow $50, buy the stock, and earn the dividend yield, locking in a riskless profit.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "American options can be exercised early, and this is optimal when the intrinsic value (immediate exercise) exceeds the present value of holding the option (continuation value). This typically occurs for deep in-the-money puts when the time value of money on the exercise proceeds exceeds the remaining optionality. OTM options (A) would never be exercised early. The risk-neutral probability (C) is irrelevant to the early exercise decision.",
