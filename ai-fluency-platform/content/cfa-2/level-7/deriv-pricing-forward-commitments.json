The FRA rate is derived from the term structure:\n\n$$FRA(a, b) = \\left(\\frac{(1 + r_b)^b}{(1 + r_a)^a} - 1\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{b - a}$$\n\nWhere $r_a$ and $r_b$ are the annualized spot rates for periods $a$ and $b$."

Each leg pays a fixed or floating rate in its respective currency. Valued by comparing PV of each leg converted at the current exchange rate.\n\n### Equity Swaps\n\nOne leg pays the return on an equity index; the other pays a fixed or floating rate. Valued by marking the equity leg to market and comparing with the fixed/floating leg.\n\n### Mark-to-Market During Life\n\nAfter initiation, a swap's value changes as interest rates move. For the fixed-rate payer:\n\n$$V_{swap} = PV(\\text{floating leg}) - PV(\\text{fixed leg})$$\n\nIf rates rise, the fixed-rate payer gains (their fixed payments are below-market)."
