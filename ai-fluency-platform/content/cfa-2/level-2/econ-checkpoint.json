          "explanation": "Using CIRP: $F = S \\times \\frac{1 + r_{\\text{CHF}}}{1 + r_{\\text{USD}}} = 0.9200 \\times \\frac{1.015}{1.050} = 0.9200 \\times 0.96667 = 0.8893$. The CHF has the lower interest rate, so the USD trades at a forward discount (CHF/USD rate declines, meaning fewer CHF per USD forward). The actual forward (0.8875) differs from the CIP-implied rate (0.8893), suggesting a potential arbitrage. Option C incorrectly uses the higher rate in the numerator.",

The large interest rate differential (13.25%) is substantially offset by the expected currency depreciation of 8.0%. Option B ignores transaction costs.
