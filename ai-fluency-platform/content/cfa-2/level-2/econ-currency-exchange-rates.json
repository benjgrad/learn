      "content": "## Spot and Forward Exchange Rate Fundamentals\n\nExchange rates are quoted as **price/base** currency pairs. For example, USD/EUR = 1.10 means 1 euro costs 1.10 US dollars.\n\n### Bid-Ask Spreads\n\nDealers quote two-sided markets:\n- **Bid**: the price at which the dealer will *buy* the base currency\n- **Ask (offer)**: the price at which the dealer will *sell* the base currency\n\n$$\\text{Spread} = \\text{Ask} - \\text{Bid}$$\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Spread} = \\frac{\\text{Ask} - \\text{Bid}}{\\text{Ask}} \\times 100$$\n\nSpreads widen with:\n- Market volatility and uncertainty\n- Illiquid or exotic currency pairs\n- Large transaction sizes\n- Political risk\n\n### Triangular Arbitrage\n\nTriangular arbitrage exploits inconsistencies among three currency pairs. If the cross rate implied by two exchange rates differs from the quoted cross rate, a riskless profit is available.\n\nGiven USD/EUR and JPY/USD, the implied cross rate is:\n$$\\text{JPY/EUR} = \\text{JPY/USD} \\times \\text{USD/EUR}$$\n\nIf the actual quoted JPY/EUR differs from this implied rate, an arbitrageur can trade through all three pairs to lock in profit."

      "answer": "You transact at the ask (1.2555) because you are buying the base currency (GBP) from the dealer. The dealer sells base currency at the higher ask price. If you were selling GBP, you would receive the lower bid price of 1.2550. The dealer earns the 0.0005 spread (0.5 pips) as compensation for market-making."

The carry trade profits when UIRP fails \u2014 the high-yield currency does not depreciate as much as the interest differential predicts. Key risk: carry trades are vulnerable to **sudden unwinding** and **crash risk** during financial stress."

The expected depreciation of the USD approximately equals the interest rate differential (1.75%). Option B confuses which currency depreciates.
