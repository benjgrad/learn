      "answer": "GDP growth = \u0394A/A + \u03b1(\u0394K/K) + (1\u2212\u03b1)(\u0394L/L) = 0% + 0.3(10%) + 0.7(2%) = 3.0% + 1.4% = 4.4%. Capital contributes 3.0 percentage points and labor contributes 1.4 percentage points. Note that despite capital growing by 10%, its contribution to GDP growth is only 3% due to the 0.3 elasticity \u2014 reflecting diminishing returns."

Country A's growth is dominated by capital accumulation (0.35 \u00d7 12% = 4.2% from capital alone), which faces diminishing returns. As Country A's capital per worker rises, the marginal product of capital will decline and growth will slow. Country A's weak institutions also threaten sustainability.

Verification: Total = TFP + capital + labor = 0.8% + 4.2% + (0.65 \u00d7 2.0%) = 0.8% + 4.2% + 1.3% = 6.3%. The residual to 7.5% may reflect measurement differences.
