The quote is USD/CHF (USD is price currency, CHF is base). $F = S \\times (1 + r_{USD})/(1 + r_{CHF}) = 0.8900 \\times (1.0125)/(1.005) = 0.8900 \\times 1.00746 = 0.8966$. Wait, this gives Option B's value. Let me reconsider: if the quote is USD/CHF meaning how many USD per 1 CHF, then USD is domestic: $F = 0.8900 \\times 1.0125/1.005 = 0.8966$. But the actual forward is 0.8820, which is lower than 0.8966. So Option B is correct: implied forward is 0.8966 and the actual (0.8820) is too low.\n\nActually, the answer is A if we interpret the convention differently. With CHF/USD (CHF per USD), the forward would be different. In the standard CFA convention, USD/CHF = 0.89 means 0.89 USD per CHF. $F = 0.89 \\times (1.0125/1.005) = 0.8967$. The actual forward (0.8820) is below this, so the CHF forward is underpriced. The answer is B: implied = 0.8966, actual is too low.",

Fiscal expansion shifts the IS curve right, increasing output. Under flexible exchange rates normally fiscal policy is less effective (crowding out via currency appreciation), but at the zero lower bound, the crowding out mechanism is weakened since rates cannot rise to attract capital.
