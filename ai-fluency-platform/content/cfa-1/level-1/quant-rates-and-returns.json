      "content": "## Interest Rates: Three Interpretations\n\nAn interest rate can be viewed in three equivalent ways:\n\n1. **Required rate of return** \u2014 the minimum return an investor demands for parting with capital\n2. **Discount rate** \u2014 the rate used to find the present value of future cash flows\n3. **Opportunity cost** \u2014 the return foregone by choosing one investment over another\n\nInterest rates are composed of several building blocks:\n\n$$r = r_f + \\text{Inflation premium} + \\text{Default risk premium} + \\text{Liquidity premium} + \\text{Maturity premium}$$\n\nWhere $r_f$ is the real risk-free rate. The **nominal risk-free rate** approximates $r_f + \\text{Inflation premium}$.\n\n### Holding Period Return\n\nThe simplest return measure is the **holding period return (HPR)**, which captures total return over the entire investment period:\n\n$$R = \\frac{P_1 - P_0 + D_1}{P_0} = \\frac{P_1 + D_1}{P_0} - 1$$\n\nWhere $P_0$ is the beginning price, $P_1$ is the ending price, and $D_1$ is any income received. The HPR makes no assumptions about the length of the holding period \u2014 it could be a day, a month, or ten years."

      "answer": "HPR = ($55 + $2 - $50) / $50 = $7 / $50 = 14%. The total return includes both capital appreciation ($5) and income ($2). You divide total gain by the initial investment."

      "content": "## Arithmetic vs Geometric Mean Return\n\nWhen summarizing returns over multiple periods, the choice of mean matters enormously.\n\n### Arithmetic Mean\n\nThe simple average of periodic returns:\n\n$$\\bar{R}_A = \\frac{R_1 + R_2 + \\cdots + R_n}{n}$$\n\nThe arithmetic mean is the best **unbiased estimator of the expected single-period return**. It is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\n### Geometric Mean\n\nThe compound average return that equates starting and ending wealth:\n\n$$\\bar{R}_G = \\left[\\prod_{t=1}^{n}(1+R_t)\\right]^{1/n} - 1$$\n\nThe geometric mean is the better measure of **actual investment performance** over multiple periods because it accounts for compounding.\n\n### Example\n\nAn investment returns +50% in Year 1 and -50% in Year 2:\n\n- Arithmetic mean: $(50\\% + (-50\\%)) / 2 = 0\\%$\n- Geometric mean: $[(1.50)(0.50)]^{1/2} - 1 = (0.75)^{0.5} - 1 = -13.4\\%$\n\nStarting with \\$100: \\$100 \u00d7 1.50 \u00d7 0.50 = \\$75. You lost money, so the geometric mean correctly shows a negative return, while the arithmetic mean misleadingly suggests breakeven."

      "type": "calibrationCheck",
      "question": "Under what circumstance are the arithmetic and geometric means equal?",
      "answer": "They are equal only when every periodic return is identical (zero variance in returns). Any variability in returns causes the geometric mean to fall below the arithmetic mean. The difference increases with the volatility of returns."

      "content": "## Money-Weighted vs Time-Weighted Returns\n\nThese two methods answer different questions about portfolio performance.\n\n### Money-Weighted Return (MWR)\n\nThe MWR is the **internal rate of return (IRR)** of all cash flows into and out of the portfolio. It solves:\n\n$$\\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} = 0$$\n\nThe MWR is affected by the **timing and size of cash flows**. If an investor adds money before a strong period, the MWR exceeds the TWR (and vice versa). It measures the investor's actual experience.\n\n### Time-Weighted Return (TWR)\n\nThe TWR chains sub-period returns, removing the impact of cash flow timing:\n\n$$R_{TWR} = \\left[\\prod_{t=1}^{n}(1+R_t)\\right] - 1$$\n\nEach sub-period return is calculated between external cash flows. The TWR is the preferred method for **evaluating manager performance** because the manager typically does not control when clients add or withdraw money.\n\n### When to Use Which\n\n| Method | Best For | Affected by Cash Flows? |\n|---|---|---|\n| Money-weighted | Evaluating investor experience | Yes |\n| Time-weighted | Evaluating manager skill | No |"

      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "## Other Return Measures\n\n### Annualized Return\n\nConverts a holding period return to an annual equivalent:\n\n$$R_{annual} = (1 + R_{period})^{1/n} - 1$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of years. For a period less than one year (say 90 days): $R_{annual} = (1 + R_{90d})^{365/90} - 1$.\n\n### Continuously Compounded Return\n\n$$r_{cc} = \\ln(1 + R) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)$$\n\nContinuously compounded returns are **additive over time**: $r_{cc,total} = r_{cc,1} + r_{cc,2} + \\cdots + r_{cc,n}$, which makes them convenient for mathematical modeling.\n\n### Gross vs Net Returns\n\n- **Gross return**: Return before deducting management fees; used to evaluate the manager's investment skill\n- **Net return**: Return after management fees; what the investor actually earns\n\n### Real vs Nominal Returns\n\n$$1 + R_{real} = \\frac{1 + R_{nominal}}{1 + \\pi}$$\n\nwhere $\\pi$ is the inflation rate. Approximately: $R_{real} \\approx R_{nominal} - \\pi$.\n\n### After-Tax Return\n\n$$R_{after-tax} = R_{pre-tax} \\times (1 - t)$$\n\nwhere $t$ is the marginal tax rate.\n\n### Leveraged Return\n\nIf an investor uses leverage with equity $E$ and borrowed funds $B$ at borrowing cost $r_B$:\n\n$$R_{leveraged} = R_{portfolio} + \\frac{B}{E}(R_{portfolio} - r_B)$$\n\nLeverage magnifies both gains and losses."
