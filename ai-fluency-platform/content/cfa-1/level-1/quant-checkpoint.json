(c) Calculate the annualized Sharpe ratio. (d) If the analyst runs a regression of fund returns on benchmark returns and gets R\u00b2 = 0.72, what does this imply about how much of the fund's return variation is explained by the benchmark?",

The alpha is not statistically significant at the 5% level. The confidence interval containing zero confirms this.\n\n**(c) Annualized Sharpe Ratio:**\n\nMonthly Sharpe = Mean excess return / SD = 0.4% / 2.0% = 0.20\n\nAnnualized Sharpe = Monthly Sharpe \u00d7 \u221a12 = 0.20 \u00d7 3.464 = 0.693\n\n**(d) R\u00b2 Interpretation:**\n\n$R^2 = 0.72$ means 72% of the fund's return variation is explained by the benchmark. The remaining 28% is due to the fund's active bets (security selection, sector tilts, etc.). A high R\u00b2 suggests the fund closely tracks its benchmark."

      "question": "A portfolio manager uses Monte Carlo simulation to model a client's retirement outcomes. She assumes returns are normally distributed with \u03bc = 7% and \u03c3 = 12%. What are two important limitations of this approach that she should communicate to the client?",
      "answer": "First, normal distribution assumption: real returns are leptokurtic (fat-tailed) and negatively skewed, so the simulation may understate the probability of extreme losses. Tail events like market crashes occur more frequently than a normal distribution predicts. Second, parameter uncertainty: the assumed \u03bc = 7% and \u03c3 = 12% are estimates. Small changes in these inputs can produce significantly different retirement outcomes. The model output is only as good as these input assumptions ('garbage in, garbage out'). She should present sensitivity analysis showing how results change with different assumptions."
