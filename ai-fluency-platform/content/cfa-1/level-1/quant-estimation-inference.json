For example, the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is a point estimate of the population mean $\\mu$.\n\n### Desirable Properties of Estimators\n\n- **Unbiased**: $E(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\theta$ \u2014 on average, the estimator hits the true value\n- **Efficient**: Smallest variance among all unbiased estimators\n- **Consistent**: Converges to the true value as sample size increases\n\n### Sampling Error\n\nThe difference between a sample statistic and the population parameter:\n\n$$\\text{Sampling error} = \\bar{X} - \\mu$$\n\nSampling error exists because we observe a sample, not the entire population. It is not a \"mistake\" \u2014 it is inherent in the sampling process.\n\n### Standard Error\n\nThe **standard error** of the sample mean measures the precision of the estimate:\n\n$$\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nWhen the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is unknown (the usual case), we use the sample standard deviation:\n\n$$s_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nKey insight: standard error decreases with the **square root of sample size**. To halve the standard error, you need to quadruple the sample size."

It does **not** mean there is a 95% probability that $\\mu$ lies in this specific interval (the population mean is fixed, not random).\n\n### Common Confidence Levels and Z Critical Values\n\n| Confidence Level | $z_{\\alpha/2}$ |\n|---|---|\n| 90% | 1.645 |\n| 95% | 1.960 |\n| 99% | 2.576 |\n\n### Example\n\nSample mean = 8%, standard error = 2%, 95% confidence level:\n\n$$\\text{CI} = 8\\% \\pm 1.96 \\times 2\\% = 8\\% \\pm 3.92\\%$$\n$$\\text{CI} = [4.08\\%, 11.92\\%]$$\n\nWe are 95% confident that the true mean return lies between 4.08% and 11.92%."
