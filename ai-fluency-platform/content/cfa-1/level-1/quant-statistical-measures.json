The **sample mean** uses $\\bar{X}$ and divides by $n$ (sample size).\n\nThe **weighted mean** assigns different importance to observations:\n\n$$\\bar{X}_w = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i X_i \\quad \\text{where } \\sum w_i = 1$$\n\nPortfolio return is a weighted mean of individual asset returns.\n\n### Median\n\nThe **median** is the middle value when data is sorted. For $n$ observations, the median is at position $(n+1)/2$. The median is robust to **outliers** and is preferred when data is skewed.\n\n### Mode\n\nThe **mode** is the most frequently occurring value. A distribution can be unimodal, bimodal, or have no mode. The mode is the only measure of central tendency applicable to **nominal data**.\n\n### Harmonic Mean\n\nUseful for averaging rates (like price-to-earnings ratios or dollar-cost averaging):\n\n$$\\bar{X}_H = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{X_i}}$$\n\nRelationship: Harmonic mean $\\leq$ Geometric mean $\\leq$ Arithmetic mean (with equality only when all values are identical)."

      "answer": "The median (8) is most appropriate. The mean (13.14) is distorted by the outlier (50). The mode (8) happens to coincide with the median here. When data contains outliers or is skewed, the median provides a more representative measure of the 'typical' value."

This is called **Bessel's correction**.\n\n### Percentiles and Quartiles\n\nThe **percentile** location formula: $L_p = (n + 1) \\times \\frac{p}{100}$\n\n- **Q1** (25th percentile): separates the bottom 25%\n- **Q2** (50th percentile): the median\n- **Q3** (75th percentile): separates the top 25%\n- **Interquartile range (IQR)**: $Q3 - Q1$, captures the middle 50% of data"

Lower CV = better risk-return tradeoff. Useful for comparing investments with different expected returns.\n\n### Sharpe Ratio\n\n$$\\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}$$\n\nThe Sharpe ratio measures **excess return per unit of total risk**. Higher is better. $R_f$ is the risk-free rate and $\\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation of portfolio returns."
