      "content": "## Future Value and Present Value of a Single Sum\n\nThe **time value of money (TVM)** principle states that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because today's dollar can be invested to earn a return.\n\n### Future Value\n\n$$FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n$$\n\nWhere $r$ is the interest rate per period and $n$ is the number of periods. The term $(1+r)^n$ is the **future value factor**.\n\n### Present Value\n\n$$PV = \\frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}$$\n\nDiscounting is the reverse of compounding. The term $\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}$ is the **present value factor** (or discount factor).\n\n### Example\n\nYou invest $5,000 at 6% for 3 years:\n\n$$FV = 5{,}000 \\times (1.06)^3 = 5{,}000 \\times 1.19102 = \\$5{,}955.08$$\n\nConversely, what is $5,955.08 received in 3 years worth today at 6%?\n\n$$PV = \\frac{5{,}955.08}{(1.06)^3} = \\frac{5{,}955.08}{1.19102} = \\$5{,}000$$\n\n### Compounding Frequency\n\nWith $m$ compounding periods per year at stated annual rate $r_s$:\n\n$$FV = PV \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{r_s}{m}\\right)^{m \\times n}$$\n\nMore frequent compounding increases the effective annual rate: $EAR = \\left(1 + \\frac{r_s}{m}\\right)^m - 1$."

      "answer": "EAR = (1 + 0.08/4)^4 - 1 = (1.02)^4 - 1 = 1.08243 - 1 = 8.243%. Quarterly compounding means interest earns interest four times per year, producing a higher effective rate than the stated 8%."

How much will you accumulate?\n\n$$FV = 500 \\times \\frac{(1.005833)^{360} - 1}{0.005833} = 500 \\times \\frac{8.1165 - 1}{0.005833} = 500 \\times 1{,}219.97 = \\$609{,}985$$"

      "content": "## Uneven Cash Flows, NPV, and IRR\n\n### Uneven Cash Flows\n\nWhen cash flows are not equal, calculate the PV of each individually and sum:\n\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\n### Net Present Value (NPV)\n\n$$NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nNote that $CF_0$ is typically a negative initial investment. **Decision rule**: Accept if $NPV > 0$; the project adds value.\n\n### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nThe IRR is the discount rate that makes $NPV = 0$:\n\n$$0 = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+IRR)^t}$$\n\n**Decision rule**: Accept if $IRR > $ required rate of return.\n\n### NPV vs IRR Conflicts\n\nFor **independent projects**, NPV and IRR give the same accept/reject decision. For **mutually exclusive projects**, they can conflict due to:\n- Different project sizes\n- Different cash flow timing patterns\n\n**Always prefer NPV** when conflicts arise. NPV directly measures the dollar amount of wealth created.\n\n### Calculator Tips (BA II Plus)\n\nFor TVM problems: use the [N], [I/Y], [PV], [PMT], [FV] keys. Enter known values, press [CPT] then the unknown. Remember: cash inflows are positive, outflows are negative."
