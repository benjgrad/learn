Investors can gain exposure through several methods:\n\n| Method | Description | Characteristics |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Futures contracts** | Agreements to buy/sell at a future date and price | Most common; no physical storage; leverage |\n| **Commodity swaps** | OTC contracts exchanging fixed for floating commodity prices | Customizable; counterparty risk |\n| **Commodity ETFs/ETNs** | Exchange-traded products tracking commodity indices | Liquid; accessible to retail investors |\n| **Physical ownership** | Direct purchase and storage | Practical only for precious metals; storage costs |\n| **Equity in commodity producers** | Shares of mining, energy, or agriculture companies | Exposed to company-specific risk, not pure commodity exposure |\n\n## Components of Commodity Futures Return\n\nThe total return from holding a commodity futures position has **three components**:\n\n$$\\text{Total Return} = \\text{Spot Return} + \\text{Roll Yield} + \\text{Collateral Yield}$$\n\n- **Spot return (price return)**: change in the spot price of the commodity\n- **Collateral yield**: return earned on the cash (T-bills) posted as margin collateral\n- **Roll yield**: gain or loss from rolling expiring futures contracts into new ones"

      "question": "What is the difference between contango and backwardation, and how does each affect roll yield?",
      "answer": "In contango, futures prices are higher than the spot price (upward-sloping futures curve). When rolling, the investor sells the expiring lower-priced contract and buys the more expensive next-month contract \u2014 this creates a negative roll yield (loss). In backwardation, futures prices are lower than the spot price (downward-sloping curve). Rolling means selling the expiring higher-priced contract and buying the cheaper next-month contract \u2014 creating a positive roll yield (gain). Persistent contango can significantly erode returns even if the spot price rises."

Most commodity markets are in contango most of the time because of **storage costs** and **insurance costs** embedded in futures prices.\n\n### Backwardation (Positive Roll Yield)\n\nWhen the futures curve is downward-sloping (futures price < spot price):\n\n$$F_t < S_t \\implies \\text{Positive roll yield}$$\n\nBackwardation typically occurs when there is **strong current demand** or **supply disruptions** that make immediate delivery more valuable than future delivery.\n\n## Commodity Index Construction\n\nPopular commodity indices (S&P GSCI, Bloomberg Commodity Index) differ in:\n- **Weighting methodology**: production-weighted (GSCI) vs. diversified weights (BCOM)\n- **Commodity selection**: which commodities are included\n- **Roll schedule**: when and how futures contracts are rolled\n\nThese differences can produce significantly different returns from the \"same\" asset class."

Unlike crops, trees can be left to grow if timber prices are low, acting as a natural \"store of value.\" This optionality is a significant benefit not available in most other commodities.\n\n### Diversification Benefits of Natural Resources\n\n- Commodities provide **inflation protection** because their prices are often a component of inflation indices\n- Low correlation with stocks and bonds improves portfolio risk-adjusted returns\n- Gold specifically acts as a **safe-haven asset** during geopolitical uncertainty\n- Farmland and timberland provide stable, income-generating exposure to real assets"

      "title": "An investor holds a long commodity futures position. The current spot price is $50, the current (near-month) futures price is $50, and the next-month futures contract trades at $52. The collateral (margin) earns 4% annually. Over one month: (1) Spot price rises to $53. (2) The investor rolls into the next-month contract at $52. Calculate the approximate one-month total return, breaking it into spot return, roll yield, and collateral yield.",
      "solution": "**Spot Return:**\nSpot moved from $50 to $53: $(53 - 50) / 50 = +6.0\\%$\n\n**Roll Yield:**\nThe investor exits the near-month contract (converging to spot at $53) and enters the next-month contract at $52. But the roll yield comes from the difference between the expiring contract and the new contract at the time of rolling:\nRoll yield $\\approx (50 - 52) / 50 = -4.0\\%$ (contango creates a loss, as the investor buys the more expensive contract)\n\nMore precisely, the investor's futures position gained from the spot move but loses on the roll, so roll yield reflects the cost of maintaining the position.\n\n**Collateral Yield:**\n$4\\% / 12 \\approx +0.33\\%$ (one month of T-bill return)\n\n**Total Return:**\n$6.0\\% + (-4.0\\%) + 0.33\\% \\approx +2.33\\%$\n\nDespite a 6% spot price increase, the investor captured only about 2.3% due to contango's negative roll yield."

When rolling, the investor closes the expiring contract (converging toward spot) and opens a new position in the higher-priced next-month contract.

          "explanation": "Trees grow biologically at 2-8% per year regardless of market conditions. If timber prices are low, the owner can defer harvesting and let trees continue growing in volume, essentially storing value on the stump.

Option C ignores roll yield and collateral yield. This illustrates why commodity futures returns can differ substantially from spot price changes.",
