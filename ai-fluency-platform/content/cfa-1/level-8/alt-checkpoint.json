The goal is to recall and explain these ideas **without scrolling back** to the modules. If you find yourself struggling with a concept, that is valuable information \u2014 revisit that module before moving to Portfolio Management.\n\n### Concept Recall"

      "title": "A pension fund allocates 5% of its $2 billion portfolio to alternative investments. The allocation committee is considering three options: (A) A private equity fund with a 2/20 fee structure, 10-year lock-up, and target net IRR of 15%; (B) A public REIT ETF with 0.3% expense ratio and daily liquidity; (C) A managed futures fund with a 1/15 fee structure, quarterly redemptions, and low equity correlation. For each option, identify the primary benefit and primary risk. Then recommend a split of the 5% allocation across the three, with your reasoning.",
      "solution": "**Option A \u2014 Private Equity Fund:**\n- Primary benefit: Highest return potential (15% net IRR target), illiquidity premium\n- Primary risk: 10-year lock-up with no liquidity; J-curve effect means negative early returns; high fees\n\n**Option B \u2014 Public REIT ETF:**\n- Primary benefit: Daily liquidity, low fees, real estate diversification, income from dividends\n- Primary risk: Behaves like equities in the short term (high correlation with stock market); interest rate sensitivity\n\n**Option C \u2014 Managed Futures:**\n- Primary benefit: Low equity correlation, potential crisis alpha (positive returns during equity bear markets)\n- Primary risk: Can underperform during prolonged bull markets; trend-following can produce losses in choppy, directionless markets\n\n**Recommended allocation (of the 5% = $100M):**\n- PE Fund: 2% ($40M) \u2014 for long-term return enhancement; pension fund's long horizon suits the lock-up\n- REIT ETF: 1.5% ($30M) \u2014 for income, liquidity, and real estate exposure\n- Managed Futures: 1.5% ($30M) \u2014 for diversification and crisis hedging\n\nReasoning: The pension fund's long horizon supports illiquid PE. REITs provide income and liquidity. Managed futures add portfolio protection during equity downturns, addressing the pension's liability risk."

      "content": "Alternative Investments fluency at CFA Level I means understanding the unique structures, fee arrangements, and performance measures that distinguish alternatives from traditional investments. You should be able to calculate management and incentive fees with hurdle rates and high-water marks, interpret IRR and MOIC for private capital, value property using cap rates, decompose commodity futures returns, describe major hedge fund strategies, and articulate the investment case and risks for digital assets. If you can explain these concepts and perform these calculations, you are ready for Portfolio Management."
