      "content": "## What Are Hedge Funds?\n\nHedge funds are **actively managed, pooled investment vehicles** that use a wide range of strategies, often including leverage, short selling, and derivatives, to generate returns. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds:\n\n- Are typically organized as **limited partnerships** (GP/LP structure)\n- Are available only to **accredited or institutional investors**\n- Charge **management fees plus incentive fees** (commonly \"2 and 20\")\n- Impose **lock-up periods** (1-3 years initially) and **redemption notice periods** (30-90 days)\n- Have **less regulatory disclosure** than public funds\n- Use a **prime broker** for trade execution, securities lending (for short selling), leverage, and custody\n\n## Hedge Fund Strategies: Equity\n\n### Long/Short Equity\n\nThe most common hedge fund strategy. The manager buys undervalued stocks (long) and sells overvalued stocks short.\n\n- **Net exposure** = Long exposure - Short exposure\n- A fund that is long $100M and short $60M has **net long exposure of $40M** and **gross exposure of $160M**\n- Returns come from **stock selection** (alpha) on both sides, not just market direction\n\n### Equity Market Neutral\n\nA special case of long/short equity where net exposure is maintained near **zero**:\n\n- Equal dollar amounts long and short (or beta-adjusted to zero)\n- Returns depend **entirely** on stock selection, not market direction\n- Lower volatility but also lower expected returns than long/short equity"

      "question": "A hedge fund is long $80M and short $80M (market neutral). The market rises 15%. Is the fund guaranteed to earn zero?",
      "answer": "No. Market neutral means the fund has approximately zero net market exposure, so the broad market move of +15% should not directly affect the portfolio's return. However, the fund's return depends on stock selection: if the long positions outperform the short positions, the fund profits; if the shorts outperform the longs, the fund loses. For example, if the longs rise 20% (+$16M) and the shorts rise 10% (-$8M covering cost, so +$8M gain on the short side), the fund earns $16M - $8M... actually wait \u2014 on the shorts, the fund loses when shorts go up: short side loses $8M, long side gains $16M, net = +$8M. Market neutral eliminates market risk but not stock-specific risk."

These strategies typically use significant leverage because mispricings are small.\n\n## Hedge Fund Strategies: Macro and CTA\n\n### Global Macro\n\nMakes **directional bets** on macroeconomic trends:\n- Interest rates, currencies, equity indices, commodities\n- Top-down approach based on economic and political analysis\n- Can be highly leveraged with large position sizes\n\n### Managed Futures (CTA)\n\n- Systematic, **trend-following** strategies using futures contracts\n- Algorithmic models that go long in uptrends and short in downtrends\n- Trade across commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equity indices\n- Historically show **positive returns during equity bear markets** (crisis alpha)"

It will benefit from rising markets (but only capture about half of the market move).\n- The fund uses **2x leverage** (200% gross exposure). For every $1 of NAV, the fund has $2 of total positions. This means the fund has borrowed money or used margin to take positions exceeding its capital.\n- The short side ($90M) provides partial hedging but not full market neutrality."

During a prolonged equity bear market, trend-following models establish short positions in declining equity indices and may go long in rising asset classes (e.g., bonds, gold). This historically provides 'crisis alpha.' Option A would likely lose money because net long exposure means the fund is still partially directional with the market. Option C depends on deal completion, which may be harder during bear markets (financing difficulties, deal cancellations).",
