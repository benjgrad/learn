The main strategies differ by company stage, risk, and return profile.\n\n### Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)\n\nThe GP acquires a mature company using a **significant amount of debt** (leverage), typically 50-75% of the purchase price. Returns are generated through:\n\n1. **Operational improvements** \u2014 cost cutting, revenue growth, management upgrades\n2. **Financial engineering** \u2014 using cash flows to repay debt, increasing equity value\n3. **Multiple expansion** \u2014 selling at a higher EV/EBITDA multiple than purchase price\n\n### Venture Capital (VC)\n\nInvests in **early-stage companies** with high growth potential but unproven business models:\n\n| Stage | Description | Risk Level |\n|---|---|---|\n| Seed/Angel | Pre-revenue, concept stage | Very high |\n| Early stage | Product developed, initial revenue | High |\n| Late stage/Growth | Proven model, scaling | Moderate-high |\n\nVC portfolios follow a **power law distribution**: most investments fail, but a few \"home runs\" (10-100x returns) drive overall fund performance.\n\n### Growth Equity\n\nInvests in **established, profitable companies** seeking capital to expand. Less leverage than LBOs, less risk than VC. Typically takes a **minority stake**."

      "question": "In a leveraged buyout, what happens to the equity investor's return if the acquired company's value declines by 20%?",
      "answer": "Leverage amplifies losses just as it amplifies gains. If a company is purchased for $500M with $150M equity and $350M debt, and its value falls 20% to $400M, the equity value drops from $150M to $50M ($400M - $350M debt). That is a 67% loss on equity, even though the company declined only 20%. If the value falls to $350M or below, the equity is completely wiped out (100% loss). This asymmetric risk is why LBO investors demand high expected returns."

If the company defaults, mezzanine lenders are repaid after senior lenders but before equity holders."

      "title": "A PE firm acquires a company for $400 million using $120 million of equity and $280 million of debt. After 4 years, the company is sold for $600 million. The debt balance at exit is $200 million (principal repaid from cash flows). Calculate: (1) the equity return multiple (MOIC), (2) the approximate equity IRR, and (3) what the MOIC would be if no leverage were used.",
      "solution": "**Step 1: Equity MOIC (with leverage)**\nEquity at entry = $120M\nEquity at exit = $600M sale price - $200M remaining debt = $400M\n\n$$MOIC = \\frac{400}{120} = 3.33\\times$$\n\n**Step 2: Approximate equity IRR**\nUsing the relationship: $120M \\times (1 + IRR)^4 = 400M$\n\n$(1 + IRR)^4 = 3.33$\n$1 + IRR = 3.33^{0.25} = 1.351$\n$IRR \\approx 35.1\\%$\n\n**Step 3: MOIC without leverage**\nIf the PE firm used all equity ($400M) and sold for $600M:\n\n$$MOIC = \\frac{600}{400} = 1.50\\times$$\n\nLeverage amplified the MOIC from 1.50x to 3.33x. The unlevered IRR would be approximately $(1.50)^{0.25} - 1 = 10.7\\%$. Leverage nearly tripled the IRR from ~11% to ~35%."

Option A describes senior debt. Option C is incorrect \u2014 nothing is junior to equity.",
