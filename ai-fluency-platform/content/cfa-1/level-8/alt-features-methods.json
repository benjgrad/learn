      "content": "## What Are Alternative Investments?\n\nAlternative investments are asset classes **outside** traditional stocks, bonds, and cash. They include:\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|---|---|\n| Private equity | LBOs, venture capital, growth equity |\n| Hedge funds | Long/short, global macro, event-driven |\n| Real assets | Real estate, infrastructure, farmland, timberland |\n| Commodities | Oil, gold, agricultural products |\n| Digital assets | Cryptocurrencies, tokens |\n\n### Common Characteristics\n\n- **Illiquidity** \u2014 many alternatives have lock-up periods of 5-10+ years\n- **Limited transparency** \u2014 less regulatory disclosure than public markets\n- **Complex legal structures** \u2014 often organized as limited partnerships\n- **Higher fees** \u2014 management fees plus performance-based incentive fees\n- **Low correlation** \u2014 potential diversification benefits relative to traditional assets\n- **Manager skill dependency** \u2014 returns depend heavily on manager selection"

      "question": "Why might an investor accept the illiquidity of alternative investments?",
      "answer": "Investors accept illiquidity in exchange for an expected illiquidity premium \u2014 higher returns to compensate for the inability to easily sell the investment. Additionally, alternatives may provide diversification benefits through low correlation with traditional assets, potentially improving the portfolio's risk-adjusted return. The illiquidity also prevents investors from making emotional, short-term trading decisions."

      "content": "## Fund Structures\n\n### Limited Partnership (LP/GP)\n\nThe dominant structure for private equity and hedge funds:\n\n- **General Partner (GP)** \u2014 the fund manager; makes investment decisions, has unlimited liability, and earns fees\n- **Limited Partners (LPs)** \u2014 investors (pensions, endowments, high-net-worth individuals); liability limited to their capital commitment\n- LPs make a **capital commitment** and the GP issues **capital calls** (drawdowns) when investments are identified\n- **Distributions** return capital and profits to LPs as investments are realized\n\n### Open-End vs. Closed-End Funds\n\n| Feature | Open-End | Closed-End |\n|---|---|---|\n| Subscriptions | Accept new investors on a rolling basis | Fixed fundraising period |\n| Redemptions | Periodic (with notice periods) | No redemptions; fixed term (typically 10-12 years) |\n| Valuation | NAV-based | Reported NAV, but secondary market pricing |\n| Typical use | Hedge funds, open-end real estate | Private equity, venture capital |\n\nOpen-end funds face **liquidity mismatch risk**: they hold illiquid assets but promise periodic redemptions. During market stress, redemption requests may force fire sales."
