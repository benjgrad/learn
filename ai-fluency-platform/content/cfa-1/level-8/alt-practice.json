          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Enhanced or optimized roll strategies (also called 'smart beta' commodity strategies) aim to improve returns by:\n\n- **Selecting contract months** that minimize negative roll yield (avoiding the steepest part of the contango curve)\n- **Rolling earlier or later** than the standard roll schedule\n- **Using implied roll yield** as a signal for contract selection\n\nTraditional indices (like S&P GSCI) mechanically roll into the nearest contract regardless of curve shape, which can result in significant negative roll yield during persistent contango. Enhanced strategies have historically improved returns by 2-4% per annum in contango-prone markets.",
