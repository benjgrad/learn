      "content": "## Why Standard Return Measures Fall Short\n\nTraditional return measures like time-weighted returns (TWR) assume investors can freely add or withdraw capital. Alternative investments violate this assumption because:\n\n- **Capital calls** are irregular \u2014 the GP decides when to draw capital\n- **Distributions** are irregular \u2014 returns come as investments are exited\n- **The investor does not control the timing** of cash flows\n\nThis makes **money-weighted return (IRR)** and **multiples** the standard performance measures for private capital.\n\n## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nThe IRR is the discount rate that sets the net present value of all cash flows to zero:\n\n$$NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+IRR)^t} = 0$$\n\n### Gross IRR vs. Net IRR\n\n| Measure | Deducts | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Gross IRR** | Fund-level expenses only (transaction costs, monitoring fees) | Evaluates the GP's investment skill |\n| **Net IRR** | All fees (management fee, carried interest, fund expenses) | Measures what the LP actually earns |\n\nThe difference between gross and net IRR reflects the **total cost of the fee structure** to the investor."

      "question": "A fund reports a gross IRR of 22% and a net IRR of 15%. What does the 7 percentage point gap tell you?",
      "answer": "The 7 percentage point gap represents the total drag from all fees and expenses \u2014 management fees, incentive fees (carried interest), and fund-level expenses. While the GP generated 22% gross returns through investment selection, the LP earned only 15% after paying for the privilege. This gap is significant: on a $100M commitment over 10 years, the difference compounds substantially. Investors should always evaluate net IRR, not gross IRR, when assessing whether a fund justifies its fees."

But MOIC does not tell you **how long** it took.\n\n### IRR vs. MOIC: Complementary Measures\n\n| Scenario | IRR | MOIC | Interpretation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Quick flip | High | Moderate | Fast return but small absolute gain |\n| Patient compounder | Moderate | High | Large absolute gain over a longer period |\n\nA fund that returns $2 on $1 in 2 years has an IRR of ~41%. The same $2 on $1 in 7 years has an IRR of ~10%. Both have a 2.0x MOIC."

      "content": "## The J-Curve Effect\n\nPrivate equity funds typically show **negative returns in early years** before generating positive returns later. This pattern, when plotted over time, resembles the letter J.\n\n**Why the J-curve occurs:**\n1. **Management fees** are charged on committed capital from day one, but investments have not yet appreciated\n2. **Portfolio companies** are valued at cost initially, with write-ups coming only after operational improvements\n3. **Organizational costs** (legal, setup) are front-loaded\n4. **Losers are marked down early**, while winners take years to mature\n\n## Vintage Year Analysis\n\nA fund's **vintage year** is the year it begins making investments. Comparing funds across different vintage years is misleading because market conditions vary. A 2006-vintage fund faced the 2008 crisis; a 2009-vintage fund bought distressed assets cheaply.\n\n**Best practice**: Compare a fund's performance to other funds of the **same vintage year**.\n\n## Public Market Equivalent (PME)\n\nPME answers: *Would the investor have been better off in a public market index?* It discounts the fund's cash flows using the public market index return and compares the result to the fund's actual distributions. A PME > 1.0 means the fund **outperformed** the public market equivalent."

Calculate the MOIC. Then explain qualitatively why this fund's IRR would be lower than a fund with the same total cash flows but all capital called in Year 0.",
      "solution": "**MOIC Calculation:**\n\nTotal invested capital = $30M + $20M = $50M\nTotal distributions = $5M + $15M + $25M + $40M = $85M\n\n$$MOIC = \\frac{85}{50} = 1.70\\times$$\n\nThe fund returned 1.70x invested capital.\n\n**IRR comparison:**\nIf all $50M were called in Year 0, the investor's money would be working for the full 5 years. With the staggered calls, the $20M called in Year 1 only works for 4 years. Because IRR is a money-weighted measure, having capital called later (idle longer in the LP's account) means less capital-at-work time. However, the given fund's IRR would actually be **higher** than the all-at-Year-0 scenario because the $20M delay means less capital is at risk for less time, improving the rate of return. The MOIC is the same in both cases (1.70x), demonstrating why IRR and MOIC provide complementary information."

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "The J-curve effect occurs because private equity funds incur management fees and organizational costs immediately while investments are initially carried at cost or may be written down.

          "explanation": "IRR is time-sensitive (annualized) while MOIC is not. Fund A's higher IRR but lower MOIC indicates it generated a smaller total gain (1.5x vs. 2.5x) but did so much faster, producing a higher annualized return. For example, turning $1 into $1.50 in 2 years yields an IRR of ~22%, while turning $1 into $2.50 in 8 years yields an IRR of ~12%. Option A would affect the gap between gross and net IRR, not the IRR-MOIC pattern. Option C is not supported by the data.",
