      "content": "## Modigliani-Miller Propositions\n\nThe **Modigliani-Miller (MM) propositions** form the theoretical foundation of capital structure theory.\n\n### MM Proposition I (No Taxes): Capital Structure Irrelevance\n\nIn a world with no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, and perfect capital markets:\n\n$$V_L = V_U$$\n\nThe value of a levered firm ($V_L$) equals the value of an unlevered firm ($V_U$). Capital structure is irrelevant \u2014 the total pie is the same regardless of how it is sliced between debt and equity.\n\n### MM Proposition II (No Taxes): Cost of Equity Increases with Leverage\n\n$$r_E = r_0 + (r_0 - r_D) \\times \\frac{D}{E}$$\n\nWhere $r_0$ is the cost of capital for an all-equity firm, $r_D$ is the cost of debt, and $D/E$ is the debt-to-equity ratio.\n\nAs leverage increases, equity becomes riskier, so equity holders demand a higher return. This exactly offsets the benefit of cheaper debt, keeping WACC constant.\n\n### MM Proposition I (With Taxes)\n\nWhen corporate taxes exist, debt creates a **tax shield** because interest is tax-deductible:\n\n$$V_L = V_U + t_c \\times D$$\n\nThe value of the levered firm exceeds the unlevered firm by the present value of the interest tax shield ($t_c \\times D$ for perpetual debt). This implies firms should use **maximum debt** \u2014 which clearly contradicts reality."

      "question": "If MM with taxes says firms should use maximum debt, what real-world factors prevent this?",
      "answer": "Several factors limit debt usage: (1) **Bankruptcy costs** \u2014 as debt increases, the probability of financial distress rises, creating direct costs (legal, administrative) and indirect costs (lost customers, suppliers, and employees). (2) **Agency costs of debt** \u2014 asset substitution, underinvestment, and excessive risk-taking. (3) **Loss of financial flexibility** \u2014 high debt limits the ability to raise capital for future opportunities. (4) **Personal taxes** \u2014 can offset some of the corporate tax advantage of debt. The **trade-off theory** balances the tax benefits of debt against these costs to find an optimal capital structure."

      "content": "## Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nThe **WACC** is the blended cost of a company's financing sources, weighted by their proportions in the **target capital structure**.\n\n$$\\text{WACC} = w_E \\times r_E + w_D \\times r_D \\times (1 - t_c)$$\n\nWhere:\n- $w_E$ = weight of equity = $E / (D + E)$\n- $w_D$ = weight of debt = $D / (D + E)$\n- $r_E$ = cost of equity\n- $r_D$ = cost of debt (pre-tax)\n- $t_c$ = corporate tax rate\n\nThe $(1 - t_c)$ adjustment reflects the tax deductibility of interest.\n\n### Example\n\nA company has 60% equity and 40% debt. Cost of equity = 12%, pre-tax cost of debt = 6%, tax rate = 25%.\n\n$$\\text{WACC} = 0.60 \\times 0.12 + 0.40 \\times 0.06 \\times (1 - 0.25)$$\n$$= 0.072 + 0.018 = 0.090 = 9.0\\%$$\n\n### Optimal Capital Structure\n\nThe **optimal capital structure** minimizes WACC and maximizes firm value. At low levels of debt, increasing leverage reduces WACC (tax shield benefit). Beyond a point, financial distress costs rise faster than tax benefits, and WACC increases. The minimum WACC corresponds to the optimal debt level."

      "content": "## Estimating the Cost of Equity and Debt\n\n### Cost of Equity \u2014 CAPM\n\nThe **Capital Asset Pricing Model** is the most commonly used method:\n\n$$r_E = r_f + \\beta \\times (r_m - r_f)$$\n\nWhere $r_f$ is the risk-free rate, $\\beta$ is the stock's systematic risk, and $(r_m - r_f)$ is the equity risk premium.\n\n**Example**: $r_f$ = 4%, $\\beta$ = 1.3, equity risk premium = 6%:\n\n$$r_E = 4\\% + 1.3 \\times 6\\% = 4\\% + 7.8\\% = 11.8\\%$$\n\n### Cost of Equity \u2014 Dividend Discount Model (DDM)\n\n$$r_E = \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g$$\n\nWhere $D_1$ is next year's expected dividend, $P_0$ is the current stock price, and $g$ is the sustainable growth rate.\n\n**Example**: $D_1$ = $2.50, $P_0$ = $40, $g$ = 5%:\n\n$$r_E = \\frac{2.50}{40} + 0.05 = 0.0625 + 0.05 = 11.25\\%$$\n\n### Cost of Equity \u2014 Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium\n\n$$r_E = r_D + \\text{Risk Premium}$$\n\nAdd a risk premium (typically 3-5%) to the company's own bond yield. Simple but subjective.\n\n### Cost of Debt\n\nThe **yield to maturity** on the company's existing bonds or the rate on new borrowing. The after-tax cost of debt is:\n\n$$r_D \\times (1 - t_c)$$\n\nFor companies without publicly traded bonds, use the yield on comparable-rated bonds."
