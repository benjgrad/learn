      "content": "## Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships\n\nThe simplest business forms are **sole proprietorships** and **partnerships**. These are easy to establish but carry significant limitations for growth.\n\n### Sole Proprietorship\n\nA business owned and operated by a single individual. The owner has **unlimited personal liability** \u2014 creditors can pursue the owner's personal assets if the business cannot pay its debts. Income is taxed once at the owner's personal rate (single taxation). The business has a **limited life** tied to the owner.\n\n### Partnerships\n\n**General partnerships** involve two or more owners who share management responsibilities and profits. All general partners bear **unlimited liability** and are **jointly and severally liable** \u2014 each partner can be held responsible for the full amount of partnership debts.\n\n**Limited partnerships (LPs)** have at least one general partner (with unlimited liability and management authority) and one or more limited partners. Limited partners enjoy **liability limited to their investment** but generally cannot participate in management without losing their limited liability protection.\n\n| Feature | Sole Proprietorship | General Partnership | Limited Partnership |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Liability | Unlimited | Unlimited (joint & several) | GP: Unlimited; LP: Limited |\n| Taxation | Single (personal) | Single (pass-through) | Single (pass-through) |\n| Life | Limited | Limited | Limited |\n| Management | Owner only | All partners | General partner(s) |"

      "question": "In a limited partnership, if the business goes bankrupt owing $2 million and a limited partner invested $50,000, what is the maximum that limited partner can lose?",
      "answer": "$50,000. A limited partner's liability is limited to their capital contribution. They cannot be required to contribute additional funds or have personal assets seized \u2014 provided they did not participate in management. The general partner, however, bears unlimited liability and could be personally responsible for the full $2 million shortfall."

      "content": "## Corporations\n\nA **corporation** is a legal entity separate from its owners. This separation provides critical advantages that make corporations the dominant form for large businesses.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Limited liability**: Shareholders can lose only their invested capital, not personal assets\n- **Perpetual life**: The corporation continues regardless of changes in ownership\n- **Transferability of ownership**: Shares can be bought and sold freely, especially for publicly traded companies\n- **Access to capital**: Can issue equity and debt securities to large pools of investors\n- **Professional management**: Managed by hired executives rather than owners directly\n\n### Double Taxation\n\nThe major disadvantage of the traditional C-corporation is **double taxation**:\n\n$$\\text{After-tax income to shareholder} = \\text{Earnings} \\times (1 - t_c) \\times (1 - t_p)$$\n\nWhere $t_c$ is the corporate tax rate and $t_p$ is the personal tax rate on dividends.\n\n**Example**: A corporation earns $100 and faces a 21% corporate rate and 15% dividend rate:\n\n$$\\$100 \\times (1 - 0.21) \\times (1 - 0.15) = \\$79 \\times 0.85 = \\$67.15$$\n\nCompare this to a partnership where the same $100 taxed once at 37% yields $63.00 \u2014 the relative advantage depends on the specific tax rates involved."

      "content": "## Other Organizational Forms\n\n### Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)\n\nLLCs combine the **limited liability** of a corporation with the **pass-through taxation** of a partnership. Members are not personally liable for business debts, and profits flow through to members' personal tax returns without corporate-level taxation. LLCs offer flexibility in management structure and profit distribution.\n\n### Cooperatives\n\nCooperatives are owned and controlled by their **members** (customers, employees, or producers) rather than outside investors. Each member typically has one vote regardless of their investment. Cooperatives operate for the benefit of members rather than to maximize profit. Common examples include credit unions, agricultural cooperatives, and consumer cooperatives.\n\n### Separation of Ownership and Control\n\nIn corporations, **owners (shareholders)** are typically separate from **managers (executives)**. This creates the **principal-agent problem**:\n\n- **Principals** (shareholders) hire **agents** (managers) to run the company\n- Agents may pursue their own interests (higher pay, empire building, risk avoidance) rather than maximizing shareholder value\n- This conflict requires **corporate governance mechanisms** to align interests\n\nMechanisms to mitigate agency conflicts include:\n- Board of directors oversight\n- Performance-based compensation (stock options, bonuses)\n- Threat of takeover (market for corporate control)\n- Shareholder activism and proxy voting"
