However, too much working capital may signal inefficiency \u2014 excess cash, bloated inventory, or slow collections.\n\n### Liquidity Ratios\n\n**Current ratio**:\n\n$$\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}$$\n\nA broad measure of liquidity. A ratio above 1.0 indicates current assets exceed current liabilities. However, it includes potentially illiquid assets like inventory.\n\n**Quick ratio (acid-test)**:\n\n$$\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}$$\n\nA stricter measure that excludes inventory and prepaid expenses, focusing only on assets that can be quickly converted to cash.\n\n### Example\n\nA company reports: Cash $50, Receivables $120, Inventory $200, Prepaid expenses $30, Current liabilities $250.\n\n$$\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{50 + 120 + 200 + 30}{250} = \\frac{400}{250} = 1.60$$\n\n$$\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{50 + 120}{250} = \\frac{170}{250} = 0.68$$\n\nThe gap between 1.60 and 0.68 reveals heavy reliance on inventory \u2014 a concern if the inventory is slow-moving or perishable."

      "question": "Company A has a current ratio of 2.5 and Company B has a current ratio of 1.1. Does this necessarily mean Company A is in a better financial position?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. A very high current ratio (2.5) may indicate inefficiency \u2014 too much cash sitting idle, excessive inventory, or slow receivables collection. Company B's ratio of 1.1 could reflect efficient working capital management. The optimal ratio depends on the industry: grocery stores operate well with low ratios (fast inventory turnover, cash sales), while manufacturers may need higher ratios (slow inventory cycles). Quality of current assets matters more than the ratio alone."

      "content": "## Managing Working Capital Components\n\n### Accounts Receivable Management\n\nCompanies extend **trade credit** to customers to encourage sales. Key decisions include:\n- **Credit terms**: e.g., \"2/10 net 30\" means a 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise full payment in 30 days\n- **Credit standards**: How strict to be in granting credit\n- **Collection policies**: How aggressively to pursue overdue accounts\n\nThe annualized cost of not taking the discount \"2/10 net 30\":\n\n$$\\text{Cost} = \\frac{\\text{Discount}}{1 - \\text{Discount}} \\times \\frac{365}{\\text{Full period} - \\text{Discount period}} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} \\times \\frac{365}{20} \\approx 37.2\\%$$\n\n### Inventory Management\n\nBalancing too much inventory (storage costs, obsolescence risk) against too little (stockouts, lost sales). Just-in-time (JIT) systems minimize inventory but require reliable supply chains.\n\n### Accounts Payable Management\n\nStretching payables improves the CCC but may damage supplier relationships or forfeit early payment discounts. Companies should pay within terms unless the financing cost of early payment exceeds alternative borrowing costs.\n\n### Short-Term Financing\n\nWhen the CCC creates a financing gap, companies use:\n- **Bank lines of credit**: Committed or uncommitted revolving facilities\n- **Commercial paper**: Unsecured short-term notes issued by creditworthy firms\n- **Factoring**: Selling receivables to a third party at a discount\n- **Banker's acceptances**: Bank-guaranteed time drafts used in trade finance"
