      "content": "## Board of Directors\n\nThe board of directors is the **primary governance mechanism** in a corporation. Elected by shareholders, the board oversees management, sets strategic direction, and protects shareholder interests.\n\n### Board Structure\n\n**One-tier (unitary) board**: A single board that includes both executive (inside) directors and non-executive (outside/independent) directors. Common in the US and UK.\n\n**Two-tier board**: A supervisory board (entirely non-executive) oversees a separate management board. Common in Germany and other European countries.\n\n### Director Independence\n\n**Independent directors** have no material relationship with the company beyond their board seat. Independence is critical because independent directors can objectively evaluate management performance without conflicts of interest.\n\nBest practices recommend that a **majority of the board** should be independent, and the board chair should ideally be separate from the CEO (**separation of chair and CEO roles**). When the same person serves as both, a **lead independent director** should be appointed to provide independent oversight.\n\n### Key Board Committees\n\n| Committee | Role | Composition |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Audit** | Oversee financial reporting, internal controls, external auditor | Entirely independent |\n| **Compensation/Remuneration** | Set executive pay and incentive structures | Entirely independent |\n| **Nomination/Governance** | Identify and recommend board candidates | Majority independent |\n| **Risk** | Oversee enterprise risk management | Majority independent |"

      "question": "Why is it considered a governance weakness for the CEO to also serve as board chairman?",
      "answer": "When the CEO is also the board chairman, the same person is both the primary agent being monitored and the leader of the body responsible for monitoring. This concentrates power and can compromise the board's independence and oversight effectiveness. The CEO-chairman can control board meeting agendas, influence director nominations, and discourage dissent. Separating the roles ensures the board can independently evaluate the CEO's performance."

      "content": "## Shareholder Rights and Proxy Voting\n\nShareholders exercise control through **voting rights** at annual general meetings (AGMs) or through **proxy voting** (delegating their vote to another party).\n\n### Key Voting Mechanisms\n\n**Statutory voting (straight voting)**: Each share gets one vote per director seat. Shareholders vote on each seat separately. This favors majority shareholders because they can win every seat.\n\n**Cumulative voting**: Shareholders can allocate all their votes to one or a few candidates. If electing 5 directors and a shareholder has 100 shares, they have 500 total votes to distribute. This helps minority shareholders gain board representation.\n\n**Proxy fights**: Dissident shareholders solicit proxies from other shareholders to vote against management's proposals or to elect alternative director candidates.\n\n### Shareholder Proposals and Say-on-Pay\n\nShareholders can submit proposals for vote at the AGM. **Say-on-pay** votes give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation packages. While advisory, a significant vote against pay signals investor dissatisfaction and can pressure boards to make changes.\n\n### Takeover Defenses\n\nSome governance provisions reduce shareholder rights:\n- **Staggered (classified) boards**: Only a portion of directors stand for election each year, making hostile takeovers more difficult\n- **Poison pills**: Allow existing shareholders to buy shares at a discount if an acquirer crosses an ownership threshold\n- **Dual-class share structures**: Founders retain superior voting shares, reducing outside shareholders' influence"

      "content": "## Executive Compensation and Governance Failures\n\n### Compensation Design\n\nEffective executive compensation should **align management's interests with shareholders**. Common components include:\n\n- **Base salary**: Fixed compensation, provides stability\n- **Annual bonus**: Tied to short-term performance metrics (revenue, earnings)\n- **Stock options**: Right to buy shares at a set price, incentivizes share price appreciation\n- **Restricted stock**: Shares that vest over time, promotes retention and long-term focus\n- **Performance shares**: Vest based on achieving specific targets (ROE, TSR)\n\nPoorly designed compensation can create perverse incentives \u2014 excessive stock options may encourage risk-taking or earnings manipulation to inflate the share price.\n\n### ESG Considerations in Governance\n\nInvestors increasingly evaluate **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** factors:\n- **E**: Carbon emissions, resource usage, environmental policies\n- **S**: Labor practices, diversity, community impact, data privacy\n- **G**: Board independence, executive pay, shareholder rights, audit quality\n\n### Governance Failures\n\nNotable governance failures share common patterns: weak board oversight, conflicts of interest, inadequate internal controls, excessive risk-taking, and lack of transparency. Examples include situations where boards failed to challenge management's aggressive accounting, excessive leverage, or related-party transactions."

      "solution": "**Statutory voting:**\n\nEach seat is voted on separately. For each seat, A casts 1,000 votes and B casts 9,000 votes. B wins every seat.

Long-term value creation (A) requires longer vesting periods and broader performance metrics. Reducing leverage (C) would not directly benefit option holders.",
