      "content": "## Net Present Value (NPV)\n\n**NPV** is the most theoretically sound capital budgeting criterion. It measures the expected increase in firm value from undertaking a project.\n\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} = -CF_0 + \\frac{CF_1}{(1+r)} + \\frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}$$\n\nWhere $CF_t$ is the cash flow at time $t$ and $r$ is the required rate of return (cost of capital).\n\n**Decision rule**: Accept if NPV > 0; reject if NPV < 0.\n\nA positive NPV means the project earns more than the cost of capital, creating value for shareholders.\n\n### Example\n\nA project requires a $500,000 investment and produces cash flows of $150,000 per year for 5 years. The cost of capital is 10%.\n\n$$\\text{NPV} = -500{,}000 + \\frac{150{,}000}{1.10} + \\frac{150{,}000}{1.10^2} + \\frac{150{,}000}{1.10^3} + \\frac{150{,}000}{1.10^4} + \\frac{150{,}000}{1.10^5}$$\n\nUsing the annuity formula:\n\n$$\\text{NPV} = -500{,}000 + 150{,}000 \\times \\frac{1 - (1.10)^{-5}}{0.10} = -500{,}000 + 150{,}000 \\times 3.7908 = -500{,}000 + 568{,}618 = \\$68{,}618$$\n\nSince NPV > 0, accept the project. It adds $68,618 of value to the firm."

      "question": "If a project has an NPV of exactly zero, should the company accept or reject it? What does an NPV of zero mean?",
      "answer": "An NPV of zero means the project earns exactly its required rate of return (cost of capital) \u2014 it neither creates nor destroys value. In theory, the firm is indifferent. In practice, NPV = 0 is the breakeven point, and the company might accept it if there are strategic benefits not captured in the cash flows, or reject it due to estimation uncertainty. The key insight is that NPV = 0 does not mean zero profit \u2014 it means the project earns a fair return for its risk."

      "content": "## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nThe **IRR** is the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero:\n\n$$0 = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+\\text{IRR})^t}$$\n\n**Decision rule**: Accept if IRR > cost of capital; reject if IRR < cost of capital.\n\nFor the previous example, the IRR is approximately 15.24% (the rate that makes NPV = 0). Since 15.24% > 10% cost of capital, accept.\n\n### IRR Limitations\n\n1. **Multiple IRRs**: Projects with non-conventional cash flows (sign changes) can have multiple IRRs, making the rule ambiguous\n2. **Mutually exclusive projects**: IRR can rank projects differently than NPV. When conflicts arise, **always follow NPV**\n3. **Reinvestment assumption**: IRR implicitly assumes cash flows are reinvested at the IRR itself, which may be unrealistic\n\n### NPV vs. IRR Conflicts\n\nFor mutually exclusive projects, NPV and IRR may disagree due to differences in project scale or timing of cash flows. NPV is preferred because it directly measures value creation in dollar terms.\n\n| Criterion | NPV | IRR |\n|---|---|---|\n| Measures | Dollar value added | Percentage return |\n| Reinvestment assumption | Cost of capital | IRR itself |\n| Multiple solutions? | No | Possible |\n| Use for ranking? | Yes (preferred) | Can mislead |"

      "content": "## Other Capital Budgeting Criteria\n\n### Payback Period\n\nThe number of years to recover the initial investment from undiscounted cash flows.\n\n**Decision rule**: Accept if payback < maximum acceptable period.\n\n**Advantage**: Simple and intuitive. **Disadvantages**: Ignores time value of money, ignores cash flows after payback, and the cutoff is arbitrary.\n\n### Discounted Payback Period\n\nSame concept but uses discounted cash flows. Accounts for time value of money but still ignores post-payback cash flows.\n\n### Profitability Index (PI)\n\n$$\\text{PI} = \\frac{\\text{PV of future cash flows}}{\\text{Initial investment}} = 1 + \\frac{\\text{NPV}}{\\text{Initial investment}}$$\n\n**Decision rule**: Accept if PI > 1.0 (equivalent to NPV > 0).\n\nPI is especially useful for **capital rationing** \u2014 when a company has more positive-NPV projects than it can fund. Ranking by PI helps maximize total NPV per dollar invested.\n\nFrom our earlier example: PI = $568,618 / $500,000 = 1.137\n\n### Capital Rationing and Real Options\n\n**Capital rationing**: When budget constraints force a company to choose among positive-NPV projects, rank by PI to maximize value per dollar.\n\n**Real options**: Embedded flexibility in projects that has value beyond the static NPV analysis:\n- **Option to delay**: Wait for more information before investing\n- **Option to expand**: Scale up if the project succeeds\n- **Option to abandon**: Exit early if the project fails\n\nReal options add value to projects, meaning the true project value may exceed the static NPV."
