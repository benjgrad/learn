          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "An LLC provides limited liability for all members and pass-through taxation (avoiding double taxation). LLCs can accept investment from venture capital firms, making them suitable for startups. A general partnership (A) provides pass-through taxation but not limited liability. A C-corporation (B) provides limited liability and access to capital but subjects income to double taxation. Many VC-backed startups eventually convert to C-corps for IPO purposes, but at the startup stage, the LLC meets all three criteria.",

Existing bondholders face increased financial risk (higher leverage, greater probability of default) without additional compensation. Shareholders receive the cash dividend and benefit from the tax shield on the new debt. This is an example of the shareholder-bondholder conflict (asset substitution/risk-shifting). Bondholders are harmed, not benefited (A). The benefits are not shared equally (C) \u2014 they flow primarily to equity holders.",

DPO = $300,000 / ($3,650,000/365) = $300,000 / $10,000 = 30 days. CCC = 50 + 29.2 - 30 = 49.2 days, closest to 49 days. Option A (29 days) equals DSO alone.

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "For mutually exclusive projects (where only one can be chosen), NPV is the correct decision criterion because it directly measures value creation in dollar terms. Beta's NPV of $3.1M exceeds Alpha's $2.5M, meaning Beta adds more value to the firm. Alpha's higher IRR (A) and higher PI (C) reflect a higher percentage return and return per dollar, but these measures can mislead when comparing projects of different scale.

Network effects create barriers to entry as the product becomes more valuable with more users. High switching costs make it costly for customers to leave. A subscription model generates recurring, predictable revenue. Together, these characteristics describe a company with a wide moat and highly visible revenue stream. A narrow moat (A) implies limited competitive protection. No moat (C) contradicts the presence of network effects and switching costs.",

          "explanation": "Separating the CEO and chairman roles is a corporate governance mechanism that addresses the separation of ownership and control (the principal-agent problem). When one person holds both roles, the board's ability to independently oversee management is compromised. Splitting the roles strengthens board oversight of the CEO.
