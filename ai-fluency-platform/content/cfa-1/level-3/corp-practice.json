          "explanation": "Dual-class share structures give certain shareholders (typically founders and insiders) disproportionate voting rights relative to their economic ownership. For example, Class B shares might carry 10 votes per share while Class A shares carry 1 vote. This creates a principal-principal conflict between controlling shareholders (who hold high-vote shares) and minority shareholders (who hold low-vote shares). Controllers can make decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of minority shareholders.",
