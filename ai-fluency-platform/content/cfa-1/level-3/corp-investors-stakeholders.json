Their claims, risks, and incentives differ substantially.\n\n### Equity Investors\n\nEquity investors hold **residual claims** on the company's assets and cash flows. They receive what remains after all obligations are paid.\n\n- **Upside**: Unlimited potential gains from share price appreciation and dividends\n- **Downside**: Can lose their entire investment, but no more (limited liability)\n- **Control**: Voting rights on major corporate decisions\n- **Priority**: Last in line during liquidation\n\n### Debt Investors\n\nDebt investors hold **fixed contractual claims** \u2014 they are promised specific interest payments and return of principal.\n\n- **Upside**: Limited to contractual interest payments\n- **Downside**: Can lose principal if the borrower defaults\n- **Control**: No voting rights, but protective covenants in loan agreements\n- **Priority**: Senior to equity in liquidation\n\n| Feature | Equity | Debt |\n|---|---|---|\n| Claim type | Residual | Fixed/contractual |\n| Return | Variable (dividends + capital gains) | Fixed (interest + principal) |\n| Voting rights | Yes | No (typically) |\n| Liquidation priority | Last | Senior to equity |\n| Tax treatment | Dividends not deductible | Interest is tax-deductible |"

      "question": "A company has assets worth $80 million and debt of $60 million. What is the value of equity? If the assets decline to $50 million, what happens to equity and debt investors?",
      "answer": "Initially, equity = $80M - $60M = $20M. If assets decline to $50M, equity is wiped out (now worth $0 since the firm is insolvent), and debt investors suffer a $10M loss (receiving only $50M of their $60M claim). Equity absorbs losses first. Debt investors only lose money after equity value reaches zero, which illustrates why equity is considered riskier and demands a higher expected return."

They typically hold smaller positions, may have shorter time horizons, and often lack the resources for deep fundamental analysis. Retail investors have grown in importance with the rise of commission-free trading platforms.\n\n### Institutional Investors\n\nOrganizations that invest on behalf of others, including:\n\n- **Pension funds**: Invest retirement assets for employees; long time horizon, focus on steady returns\n- **Mutual funds**: Pool capital from many investors; managed by professional portfolio managers\n- **Insurance companies**: Invest policyholder premiums; focus on asset-liability matching\n- **Sovereign wealth funds**: Government-owned investment vehicles; very long horizon\n- **Hedge funds**: Use diverse strategies including leverage and short-selling; often activist\n- **Endowments and foundations**: University and charitable assets; perpetual time horizon\n\nInstitutional investors hold the majority of shares in large corporations and can exert significant influence through **shareholder activism** \u2014 using their ownership stake and voting power to push for changes in corporate strategy, governance, or management."

      "content": "## Stakeholder Theory and Conflicts\n\n**Stakeholder theory** holds that corporations should consider the interests of all parties affected by their operations, not just shareholders.\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n- **Shareholders**: Want to maximize share value and dividends\n- **Bondholders**: Want the company to minimize risk and honor obligations\n- **Employees**: Want job security, fair compensation, and safe working conditions\n- **Customers**: Want quality products at fair prices\n- **Suppliers**: Want reliable payment and ongoing business relationships\n- **Government/regulators**: Want tax compliance and adherence to laws\n- **Communities**: Want environmental responsibility and local economic benefit\n\n### Common Conflicts\n\n**Shareholder vs. bondholder**: Shareholders may prefer riskier projects because they capture the upside while bondholders bear downside risk. This is called the **asset substitution problem** or **risk-shifting**.\n\n**Shareholder vs. manager**: Managers may pursue empire building, excessive perks, or risk avoidance to protect their jobs \u2014 at shareholders' expense.\n\n**Shareholder vs. other stakeholders**: Maximizing short-term profits might harm employees (layoffs), communities (pollution), or customers (cost-cutting on safety).\n\n### Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n\nCSR reflects a company's commitment to operating ethically and contributing to economic development while improving quality of life for stakeholders. **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** frameworks provide investors with metrics to evaluate a company's stakeholder management."

      "title": "A company has two potential projects. Project A has expected cash flows of $10 million with low variance. Project B has expected cash flows of $10 million with very high variance (50% chance of $20M, 50% chance of $0). The company has $8 million in debt. Analyze the expected payoffs to equity and debt holders under each project.",
      "solution": "**Project A (low risk): Expected cash flow = $10M**\n\nDebt holders receive: $8M (full repayment)\n\nEquity holders receive: $10M - $8M = $2M\n\n**Project B (high risk): Expected cash flow = $10M**\n\n- Good outcome (50%): Cash flow = $20M. Debt receives $8M, equity receives $12M.\n- Bad outcome (50%): Cash flow = $0. Debt receives $0, equity receives $0.\n\nExpected payoff to debt: 0.5 x $8M + 0.5 x $0 = $4M\n\nExpected payoff to equity: 0.5 x $12M + 0.5 x $0 = $6M\n\n**Analysis**: Equity holders prefer Project B ($6M vs $2M expected) despite it having the same total expected cash flow as Project A. Debt holders prefer Project A ($8M vs $4M expected). This demonstrates the **risk-shifting problem**: equity holders benefit from increased risk at the expense of debt holders because equity captures all the upside while limited liability protects them on the downside."
