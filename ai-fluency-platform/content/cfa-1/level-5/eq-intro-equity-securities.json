      "question": "A company has cumulative preferred stock with a $4 annual dividend. The company skipped dividends for 2 years and now wants to pay a common stock dividend. How much must be paid to preferred shareholders first?",
      "answer": "The company must pay $12 per preferred share before any common dividends: $4 \u00d7 2 years of arrears = $8, plus the current year's $4 dividend = $12. With cumulative preferred stock, all missed (accumulated) dividends must be paid before common shareholders receive anything. If this were non-cumulative preferred, only the current $4 dividend would need to be paid, and the $8 in missed dividends would be permanently forfeited."
