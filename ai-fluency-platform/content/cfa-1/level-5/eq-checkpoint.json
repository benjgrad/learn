The equity multiplier (financial leverage) of 2.50\u00d7 is the largest contributor \u2014 without it, the product of margin and turnover yields only 8.0%.

Revenue grew by 20% but operating profit grew by 50% \u2014 this demonstrates operating leverage (DOL = 50%/20% = 2.5\u00d7). Fixed costs create a magnifying effect on profit changes.

Beta's 24% ROE may be largely a product of its aggressive capital structure rather than superior operating performance. Alpha's 22% ROE achieved with minimal leverage (0.3\u00d7) suggests stronger underlying profitability. Option A ignores the risk implications of Beta's high leverage. Option C draws too strong a conclusion from a single metric \u2014 a higher EV/EBITDA might be justified if Alpha has better growth prospects or lower risk.",
