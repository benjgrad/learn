      "content": "## Index Construction Methods\n\nA security market index measures the value of a specific group of securities. The key design choice is how to **weight** the constituent securities.\n\n### Price-Weighted Index\n\nEach security is weighted by its **price per share**. Higher-priced stocks have more influence.\n\n$$\\text{Index Value} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i}{D}$$\n\nWhere $P_i$ is the price of stock $i$ and $D$ is the divisor (adjusted for stock splits and index changes).\n\n**Example:** Three stocks priced at \\$20, \\$50, and \\$30 with a divisor of 3:\n\n$$\\text{Index} = \\frac{20 + 50 + 30}{3} = 33.33$$\n\nIf the \\$50 stock rises 10% to \\$55, the index becomes $(20 + 55 + 30)/3 = 35.00$, a 5.0% increase. But if the \\$20 stock rises 10% to \\$22, the index becomes $(22 + 50 + 30)/3 = 34.00$, only a 2.0% increase. The higher-priced stock dominates.\n\n**Examples:** Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Nikkei 225\n\n**Bias:** Price-weighted indices give arbitrary overweighting to high-priced stocks regardless of their market capitalization."

      "question": "A price-weighted index has three stocks: A at $100, B at $50, and C at $25. Stock C undergoes a 5-for-1 stock split. What happens to the index, and how is it adjusted?",
      "answer": "The stock split reduces C's price from $25 to $5, but the index value should not change due to a split. The divisor is adjusted downward so the index value remains the same. Before split: (100 + 50 + 25)/3 = 58.33. After split, the new divisor D satisfies: (100 + 50 + 5)/D = 58.33, so D = 155/58.33 = 2.657. This is a key weakness of price-weighted indices: the split reduces Stock C's weight in the index even though nothing fundamentally changed."

      "content": "## Index Management: Rebalancing and Reconstitution\n\n### Rebalancing\n\nRebalancing restores index weights to their target values. The frequency depends on the weighting method:\n\n- **Price-weighted:** No rebalancing needed (weights adjust automatically with prices)\n- **Market cap-weighted:** Minimal rebalancing (weights adjust naturally as prices change)\n- **Equal-weighted:** Frequent rebalancing required (must sell winners and buy losers to restore equal weights)\n- **Fundamental-weighted:** Periodic rebalancing to realign with fundamental values\n\n### Reconstitution\n\nReconstitution is the process of **adding and removing securities** from the index based on selection criteria (e.g., market cap thresholds, liquidity). This typically occurs on a scheduled basis (quarterly or annually).\n\nReconstitution creates a **reconstitution effect:** stocks added to a major index tend to rise in price (due to buying by index funds), while deleted stocks tend to fall.\n\n### Uses of Market Indices\n\n| Use | Description |\n|---|---|\n| **Benchmarking** | Measure portfolio performance against a reference |\n| **Asset allocation** | Represent asset classes in allocation models |\n| **Index funds/ETFs** | Serve as the target for passive investment vehicles |\n| **Market sentiment** | Gauge overall market direction and investor confidence |\n| **Risk measurement** | Calculate beta and systematic risk relative to the market |"
