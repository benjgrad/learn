      "content": "## Porter's Five Forces Framework\n\nMichael Porter's five forces framework analyzes the **structural attractiveness** of an industry by examining the competitive forces that determine profitability:\n\n### 1. Threat of New Entrants\nNew competitors bring additional capacity and pressure prices downward. **Barriers to entry** protect existing firms:\n- Economies of scale\n- Capital requirements\n- Regulatory/licensing barriers\n- Brand loyalty and switching costs\n- Access to distribution channels\n\n### 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers\nPowerful suppliers can raise input costs. Supplier power is high when:\n- Few suppliers dominate\n- No substitutes for the input exist\n- The supplier's product is differentiated or has high switching costs\n\n### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers\nPowerful buyers can demand lower prices or higher quality. Buyer power is high when:\n- Buyers are concentrated or purchase large volumes\n- Products are standardized (easy to switch)\n- The product is a significant cost for the buyer\n\n### 4. Threat of Substitutes\nSubstitutes cap the prices firms can charge. The threat is high when:\n- Substitutes offer a favorable price-performance trade-off\n- Switching costs are low\n\n### 5. Intensity of Rivalry Among Existing Competitors\nIntense rivalry erodes margins through price wars, advertising battles, and product improvements. Rivalry is intense when:\n- Many competitors of similar size exist\n- Industry growth is slow\n- Fixed costs are high (pressure to fill capacity)\n- Products are undifferentiated\n- Exit barriers are high (firms stay even when unprofitable)"

      "question": "Using Porter's five forces, explain why the airline industry has historically been less profitable than the software industry.",
      "answer": "Airlines face unfavorable conditions across nearly all five forces. Rivalry is intense (many carriers, price-sensitive customers, undifferentiated service). Supplier power is high (Boeing and Airbus duopoly; fuel is a commodity with volatile pricing). Buyer power is high (price comparison is easy; low switching costs). Threat of substitutes exists (trains, cars, video conferencing). Barriers to entry are moderate (capital-intensive but new carriers do enter). Software benefits from high barriers to entry (network effects, switching costs), weak supplier power, high customer switching costs, few direct substitutes for specialized tools, and often limited rivalry due to winner-take-most dynamics."

      "content": "## Industry Life Cycle\n\nIndustries evolve through predictable stages, each with distinct characteristics for growth, competition, and profitability:\n\n| Stage | Growth | Competition | Margins | Investment |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Embryonic** | Slow initial adoption | Few competitors | Negative (high R&D) | Heavy |\n| **Growth** | Rapid acceleration | New entrants attracted | Improving | High |\n| **Shakeout** | Decelerating | Intense; weaker firms exit | Pressured | Selective |\n| **Mature** | Slow, stable | Consolidated; few large players | Stable | Maintenance |\n| **Decline** | Negative | Further consolidation | Declining | Minimal |\n\n### Implications for Analysts\n\n- **Embryonic/Growth:** Focus on revenue growth, addressable market, and competitive positioning. Losses may be acceptable if the company is gaining market share.\n- **Shakeout:** Identify survivors \u2014 companies with cost advantages, strong brands, or deep pockets.\n- **Mature:** Profitability and cash flow generation matter most. Look for pricing discipline and dividends.\n- **Decline:** Assess whether the company can harvest cash flows or pivot to new markets.\n\n### Limitations\n\nNot all industries follow this sequence neatly. Technological disruption can restart the cycle. Industries may remain in one stage for decades (e.g., utilities in the mature stage)."

      "title": "Apply Porter's five forces to analyze the streaming video industry (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, etc.).",
      "solution": "**1. Threat of New Entrants: MODERATE-HIGH**\nCapital requirements for content production are very high ($10B+ annually for major players), but large tech companies (Apple, Amazon) can subsidize losses. Brand recognition matters but isn't an insurmountable barrier.\n\n**2. Supplier Power: MODERATE-HIGH**\nContent creators (studios, talent) have significant power. Exclusive content is critical for differentiation. Streamers have responded by producing original content, becoming their own suppliers.\n\n**3. Buyer Power: HIGH**\nSubscribers can easily switch between services (low switching costs, month-to-month subscriptions). Price sensitivity is rising as the number of services grows.\n\n**4. Threat of Substitutes: MODERATE**\nSubstitutes include free social media (YouTube, TikTok), gaming, live sports, and traditional broadcast. These compete for the same finite leisure time.\n\n**5. Rivalry: HIGH**\nIntense competition for subscribers and content. Price competition, aggressive spending on originals. Growing number of players with deep pockets. Limited differentiation beyond content library.\n\n**Conclusion:** The streaming industry faces unfavorable forces in most dimensions, suggesting structurally thin margins for most participants. The industry appears to be in the shakeout stage of the life cycle."

          "options": [
            "A) Low barriers to entry and many substitutes",
            "B) High buyer concentration and standardized products",
            "C) High switching costs and strong barriers to entry"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "C",
          "explanation": "High switching costs reduce buyer power (customers are locked in), and strong barriers to entry limit the threat of new competitors. Both factors protect existing firms' profitability. Option A describes conditions that erode profitability: low barriers invite new entrants and many substitutes cap pricing power. Option B describes high buyer power (concentrated buyers of commodity products can negotiate aggressively), which reduces profitability.",
