      "content": "## Elements of Company Analysis\n\nCompany analysis is a systematic process of evaluating a business to determine whether its equity is fairly priced. The framework has several interconnected elements:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Business\n\nBefore any quantitative analysis, an analyst must understand:\n- **What does the company sell?** Products, services, or both\n- **Who are its customers?** Consumer, enterprise, government\n- **How does it make money?** Revenue model and key profit drivers\n- **What is its competitive position?** Market share, brand, cost advantages\n\n### 2. Industry Context\n\nA company's prospects are heavily influenced by its industry:\n- **Industry growth rate** \u2014 is the overall market expanding or contracting?\n- **Competitive intensity** \u2014 how many firms compete and on what basis (price, quality, innovation)?\n- **Regulatory environment** \u2014 what legal or regulatory constraints exist?\n- **Barriers to entry** \u2014 how difficult is it for new competitors to enter?\n\n### 3. Revenue and Earnings Quality\n\nNot all revenue is equal. Analysts assess **quality** by examining:\n- **Sustainability** \u2014 recurring revenue vs. one-time gains\n- **Growth trajectory** \u2014 organic growth vs. acquisition-driven growth\n- **Accounting choices** \u2014 aggressive vs. conservative recognition policies\n- **Cash conversion** \u2014 the ratio of operating cash flow to reported earnings (higher is better)"

      "question": "Company A reports $100M in net income but only $60M in operating cash flow. Company B reports $80M in net income and $95M in operating cash flow. Which company has higher earnings quality, and why?",
      "answer": "Company B has higher earnings quality. Its operating cash flow ($95M) exceeds its net income ($80M), giving a cash conversion ratio of 1.19. This means the reported earnings are well-supported by actual cash generation. Company A's operating cash flow ($60M) is only 60% of net income ($100M), suggesting that a significant portion of earnings comes from non-cash accruals (like receivables growth, deferred revenue, or aggressive accounting). Earnings backed by cash are more reliable and sustainable."

      "content": "## Absolute vs. Relative Valuation\n\n### Absolute Valuation (Intrinsic Value Models)\n\nAbsolute valuation estimates a security's value based on its **own fundamentals**, independent of how similar securities are priced.\n\n$$V_0 = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nThe intrinsic value is the present value of all expected future cash flows, discounted at the required rate of return. Common models include:\n- **Dividend discount models (DDM)** \u2014 cash flows are dividends\n- **Free cash flow models** \u2014 cash flows are FCFF or FCFE\n- **Residual income models** \u2014 excess earnings above required return on equity\n\n### Relative Valuation (Market Multiples)\n\nRelative valuation compares a company's price to a fundamental metric, then compares that multiple to peers or historical averages:\n\n$$\\text{P/E Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price per Share}}{\\text{Earnings per Share}}$$\n\n| Approach | Question Answered | Advantage | Limitation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Absolute** | What is this stock worth intrinsically? | Grounded in fundamentals | Highly sensitive to assumptions |\n| **Relative** | Is this stock cheap/expensive vs. peers? | Simple, intuitive, widely used | Assumes peers are fairly valued |\n\nBoth approaches are complementary. A thorough analysis uses **multiple valuation methods** and triangulates toward a conclusion."

The quick ratio below 1.0 suggests some reliance on inventory for short-term liquidity. The ~55-day DSO should be compared to industry peers to assess whether collections are timely."

Option A (net income growing faster than revenue) could indicate improving margins, but it could also signal aggressive accounting if not supported by cash flows. Option C (increasing deferred revenue) indicates conservative revenue recognition, but it does not directly measure cash conversion \u2014 and the question asks what 'best indicates' high quality.",

The relative valuation gives $78, also above the current price of $72 (8% upside). When multiple methods agree on the direction, the conclusion is stronger.
