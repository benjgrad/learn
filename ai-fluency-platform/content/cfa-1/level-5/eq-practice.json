          "explanation": "Before split: Index = $(30 + 50 + 20) / 3 = 33.33$\n\nAfter split: Stock B's price becomes $25 (from $50). The divisor must be adjusted so the index value doesn't change:\n\n$$33.33 = \\frac{30 + 25 + 20}{d_{new}} \\implies d_{new} = \\frac{75}{33.33} = 2.25$$\n\nWait, let me recalculate: $75 / 33.33 = 2.25$. Let me verify: Before split: $(30+50+20)/3 = 100/3 = 33.33$. After: $(30+25+20)/d = 33.33$, so $d = 75/33.33 = 2.25$.\n\nActually the answer should be 2.25, but that is not listed. Let me re-check the options. With the given options, let me reconsider: If the divisor is $2.50$, then $75/2.50 = 30.00 \\neq 33.33$. \n\nThe correct new divisor is 2.25. Among the given choices, A) 2.50 is closest. However, the proper calculation gives 2.25.",
