The analyst's job is to estimate intrinsic value and compare it to market price:\n\n- If $V_0 > P_0$: the stock is **undervalued** (buy)\n- If $V_0 < P_0$: the stock is **overvalued** (sell or avoid)\n- If $V_0 \\approx P_0$: the stock is **fairly valued**\n\n### General Dividend Discount Model (DDM)\n\nSince shareholders receive cash flows through **dividends**, the value of a stock equals the present value of all expected future dividends:\n\n$$V_0 = \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nWhere $D_t$ is the expected dividend in period $t$ and $r$ is the required rate of return on equity.\n\n### Gordon Growth Model (Constant Growth DDM)\n\nIf dividends grow at a **constant rate** $g$ forever:\n\n$$V_0 = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} = \\frac{D_0(1+g)}{r - g}$$\n\n**Example:** A stock just paid $D_0 = \\$2.00$, with $g = 5\\%$ and $r = 10\\%$:\n\n$$V_0 = \\frac{2.00 \\times 1.05}{0.10 - 0.05} = \\frac{2.10}{0.05} = \\$42.00$$\n\n**Assumptions:** $g$ must be less than $r$, and $g$ must be sustainable indefinitely (typically at or below long-term GDP growth)."

      "question": "Using the Gordon Growth Model, a stock is valued at $50 with a required return of 12% and a growth rate of 4%. If the growth rate increases to 6% (all else equal), what happens to the value and by how much?",
      "answer": "At g = 4%: V\u2080 = D\u2081/(0.12 \u2212 0.04) = D\u2081/0.08 = $50, so D\u2081 = $4.00. At g = 6%: V\u2080 = D\u2081(1+0.06)/(0.12 \u2212 0.06). But D\u2081 was based on the old growth rate. If D\u2080 is the same, then D\u2080 = $4.00/1.04 = $3.846. New D\u2081 = $3.846 \u00d7 1.06 = $4.077. V\u2080 = $4.077/0.06 = $67.95. Alternatively, if we simply re-price with the same $4.00 as D\u2081: V\u2080 = $4.00/(0.12 \u2212 0.06) = $4.00/0.06 = $66.67. The value increases significantly (from $50 to ~$67) because a higher growth rate both increases future dividends and narrows the denominator (r \u2212 g), amplifying the effect. This sensitivity to growth assumptions is a key limitation of the model."
