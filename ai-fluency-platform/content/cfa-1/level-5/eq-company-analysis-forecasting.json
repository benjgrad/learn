      "content": "## Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Forecasting\n\nAnalysts use two fundamental approaches to forecast company performance:\n\n### Top-Down Approach\n\nStart with the **macroeconomy**, then narrow to the industry, then the company:\n\n$$\\text{GDP Growth} \\rightarrow \\text{Industry Growth} \\rightarrow \\text{Company Market Share} \\rightarrow \\text{Company Revenue}$$\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Forecast economic growth (GDP, consumer spending, interest rates)\n2. Estimate industry growth based on economic conditions\n3. Estimate the company's market share within the industry\n4. Derive company revenue = Industry size \u00d7 Market share\n\n**Advantage:** Captures macroeconomic trends and ensures company forecasts are consistent with broader economic conditions.\n\n### Bottom-Up Approach\n\nStart with **company-specific data** and build upward:\n\n$$\\text{Segment Revenue} \\rightarrow \\text{Total Revenue} \\rightarrow \\text{Growth Rate}$$\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Analyze individual business segments, products, or geographies\n2. Forecast each segment based on competitive position, capacity, and pricing\n3. Aggregate segment forecasts into total company revenue\n\n**Advantage:** More granular and captures company-specific drivers. Better for companies with diverse segments or unique competitive positions.\n\n### In Practice\n\nMost analysts use **both approaches** and reconcile them. If top-down implies 5% industry growth but bottom-up forecasts 12% company growth, the analyst must justify why the company can significantly outgrow its industry."

      "question": "An analyst forecasts that a luxury goods company will grow revenue by 15% next year using a bottom-up approach. However, the top-down forecast shows the economy entering a recession with consumer spending declining 3%. How should the analyst reconcile these forecasts?",
      "answer": "The analyst should critically evaluate the 15% bottom-up forecast in light of macro headwinds. Even luxury goods companies are affected by recessions, though less than mass-market retailers. The analyst might: (1) stress-test the bottom-up assumptions against recession scenarios, (2) examine how the company performed in prior recessions, (3) consider whether new product launches or geographic expansion could offset macro weakness, and (4) adjust the revenue forecast downward if the bottom-up assumptions implicitly depend on strong consumer spending. The final forecast should be consistent with the economic outlook unless there are compelling company-specific reasons for outperformance."

      "content": "## Expense Modeling, Margins, and Pro Forma Statements\n\n### Expense Forecasting\n\nExpenses are typically modeled as either:\n- **Variable costs** \u2014 forecasted as a percentage of revenue (e.g., COGS = 60% of revenue)\n- **Fixed costs** \u2014 forecasted as a dollar amount that doesn't change with volume (e.g., rent, depreciation)\n- **Semi-variable costs** \u2014 have both fixed and variable components (e.g., salaries with commissions)\n\n$$\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Fixed Costs} + (\\text{Variable Cost per Unit} \\times \\text{Units Sold})$$\n\n### Margin Analysis\n\nProjecting margins involves analyzing the cost structure:\n\n$$\\text{Operating Margin Forecast} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Forecasted COGS + Forecasted SG\\&A + Forecasted D\\&A}}{\\text{Forecasted Revenue}}$$\n\nMargin expansion can result from: operating leverage (fixed costs spread over more revenue), pricing power, cost efficiencies, or mix shift toward higher-margin products.\n\n### Pro Forma Financial Statements\n\nA pro forma model integrates all forecasts into projected financial statements:\n\n1. **Income statement:** Revenue \u2212 COGS \u2212 SG&A \u2212 D&A \u2212 Interest \u2212 Tax = Net Income\n2. **Balance sheet:** Driven by turnover assumptions (days receivable, days inventory, days payable)\n3. **Cash flow statement:** Derived from income statement and balance sheet changes\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n| Scenario | Revenue Growth | Operating Margin | EPS |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Bull case** | 12% | 22% | $4.50 |\n| **Base case** | 7% | 19% | $3.20 |\n| **Bear case** | 2% | 15% | $1.80 |\n\nScenario analysis tests how sensitive the valuation is to different assumptions, helping analysts understand the range of possible outcomes."

      "solution": "**Scenario:** Forecast next year's revenue for a mid-sized auto parts retailer.\n\nCurrent revenue: $500M. The company operates 200 stores.\n\n**Top-Down Approach:**\n- GDP growth forecast: 2.5%\n- Auto parts industry grows at ~1.2\u00d7 GDP: 2.5% \u00d7 1.2 = 3.0%\n- Company's market share is stable at 4% of the $12.5B industry\n- Industry next year: $12.5B \u00d7 1.03 = $12.875B\n- Company revenue: $12.875B \u00d7 4% = $515M (3.0% growth)\n\n**Bottom-Up Approach:**\n- Same-store sales growth: 2% (based on traffic trends and pricing)\n- Existing 200 stores \u00d7 $2.50M avg revenue \u00d7 1.02 = $510M\n- New store openings: 8 new stores \u00d7 $2.0M avg (ramp-up year) = $16M\n- Total bottom-up: $510M + $16M = $526M (5.2% growth)\n\n**Reconciliation:**\nThe bottom-up forecast ($526M) exceeds top-down ($515M) by $11M. The difference is driven by new store openings. This is reasonable if the company is gaining market share through expansion. Final forecast: $520M (4.0% growth), reflecting some conservatism on new store ramp-up."
