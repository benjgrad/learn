In an informationally efficient market, it is impossible to consistently achieve risk-adjusted returns in excess of the market (\"alpha\") using any information already reflected in prices.\n\n### Conditions for Market Efficiency\n\nMarkets tend to be more efficient when:\n- A **large number of participants** analyze and trade securities\n- **Information is widely available** at low cost\n- **Transaction costs are low**, allowing arbitrage\n- **No restrictions** on trading (short selling allowed)\n\n### Three Forms of the EMH\n\n| Form | Information Reflected in Prices | Implication |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Weak** | All past market data (prices, volume, trading data) | Technical analysis cannot produce excess returns |\n| **Semi-strong** | All publicly available information (financial statements, news, analyst reports) | Neither technical nor fundamental analysis can produce excess returns |\n| **Strong** | All information, including private/insider information | No one \u2014 not even insiders \u2014 can achieve excess returns |\n\nEach successive form **encompasses** the previous: if the semi-strong form holds, the weak form must also hold."

      "question": "A portfolio manager consistently outperforms the market by analyzing publicly available financial statements. Which form of market efficiency does this evidence most directly contradict?",
      "answer": "This contradicts the semi-strong form of the EMH. The semi-strong form asserts that all publicly available information (including financial statements) is already reflected in prices, so fundamental analysis should not produce consistent excess returns. It also contradicts the strong form (since the strong form encompasses the semi-strong form). However, it does not necessarily contradict the weak form, which only says past price and volume data are reflected in prices."

Some may reflect **risk premiums** rather than inefficiency. Others may be artifacts of **data mining** or **survivorship bias**."

Prices generally reflect available information, but temporary mispricings can occur \u2014 especially in less liquid, less followed securities."

      "solution": "1. **A trader who profits using chart patterns and moving averages** \u2014 Violates the weak form, which states past price data is already reflected in prices. Technical analysis should not generate alpha.\n\n2. **An analyst who outperforms by carefully reading 10-K filings** \u2014 Violates the semi-strong form, which states all public information (including SEC filings) is already priced in.\n\n3. **A corporate officer who profits by trading before earnings announcements** \u2014 Violates the strong form, which states even private information is reflected in prices. (Note: this is also illegal in most jurisdictions.)\n\n4. **A quantitative fund that profits from momentum strategies** \u2014 Violates the weak form, since momentum uses past return data to predict future returns.\n\n5. **A value investor who earns alpha buying low P/B stocks** \u2014 Violates the semi-strong form, since book value is publicly available information."

Since market capitalization is publicly available information, this finding challenges the semi-strong form of the EMH.
