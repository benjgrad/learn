      "question": "What is the key difference between a broker and a dealer in financial markets?",
      "answer": "A broker acts as an agent, matching buyers with sellers and earning a commission without taking a position in the security. A dealer acts as a principal, buying and selling from their own inventory and earning the bid-ask spread. A dealer provides liquidity by always being willing to trade, while a broker only facilitates trades between other parties."

      "content": "## Market Types and Order Types\n\n### Market Structures\n\nMarkets are organized by how trades are executed:\n\n- **Quote-driven (dealer) markets** \u2014 dealers post bid and ask prices; traders transact with dealers. Example: most bond markets, OTC markets\n- **Order-driven markets** \u2014 buy and sell orders are matched by rules (price priority, then time priority). Example: most stock exchanges\n- **Brokered markets** \u2014 brokers search for counterparties for unique or illiquid assets. Example: real estate, large block trades\n\n### Order Types\n\n| Order Type | Definition | Advantage | Risk |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Market order** | Execute immediately at best available price | Certainty of execution | Price uncertainty |\n| **Limit order** | Execute only at specified price or better | Price certainty | May not be filled |\n| **Stop-loss order** | Becomes market order when stop price is reached | Limits downside | Gap risk; may execute far from stop price |\n| **Stop-limit order** | Becomes limit order when stop price is reached | Controls both trigger and execution price | May not execute in fast markets |\n\n### Execution Priority\n\nIn order-driven markets, orders are ranked by:\n1. **Price priority** \u2014 best price first (highest bid, lowest ask)\n2. **Time priority** \u2014 among orders at the same price, earliest order first\n\nA market order always has the highest execution priority because it accepts any price."

This amplifies both gains and losses.\n\n$$\\text{Leverage Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Asset Value}}{\\text{Equity}} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Margin \\%}}$$\n\n**Initial margin** is the minimum equity percentage required to open a position (e.g., 50%). **Maintenance margin** is the minimum equity to maintain it (e.g., 25%).\n\n$$\\text{Margin Call Price} = P_0 \\times \\frac{1 - \\text{Initial Margin}}{1 - \\text{Maintenance Margin}}$$\n\n**Example:** You buy 100 shares at \\$80 with 50% initial margin. Maintenance margin is 25%.\n\n$$\\text{Margin Call Price} = 80 \\times \\frac{1 - 0.50}{1 - 0.25} = 80 \\times \\frac{0.50}{0.75} = \\$53.33$$\n\nIf the stock drops below \\$53.33, you receive a margin call.\n\n### Short Selling\n\nShort selling involves borrowing shares, selling them, and later repurchasing to return. The short seller profits when the price falls.\n\n$$\\text{Short Sale Profit} = (P_{\\text{sell}} - P_{\\text{buy}}) \\times \\text{Shares} - \\text{Dividends Paid} - \\text{Borrowing Costs}$$\n\n**Key risks:** Theoretically unlimited loss (price can rise indefinitely), obligation to pay dividends to lender, short squeeze risk (forced covering at high prices)."
