      "answer": "Net profit margin = $50M / $500M = 10%. Asset turnover = $500M / $400M = 1.25x. Financial leverage = $400M / $200M = 2.0x. ROE = 10% \u00d7 1.25 \u00d7 2.0 = 25%. The financial leverage ratio of 2.0x (meaning the company has twice as many assets as equity, so half its assets are financed by debt) is a significant contributor. Without the leverage, ROA would be only 12.5% (10% \u00d7 1.25). Leverage doubles the return to equity holders but also doubles the risk."

Company X achieves its 15% ROE through higher leverage and higher asset turnover but lower margins, while Company Y achieves it through superior margins with less leverage. Company X is more vulnerable to earnings declines because of its higher debt burden. Option B is incorrect because Company Y has lower leverage. Option C is incorrect because leverage differs significantly.",
