This is the primary reason US companies elect LIFO.\n\nHowever, LIFO inventory on the balance sheet reflects **outdated costs**, understating the economic value of inventory. This creates two critical adjustments:\n\n- **LIFO reserve** = FIFO inventory - LIFO inventory\n- The LIFO reserve is disclosed in the notes and allows analysts to convert LIFO statements to FIFO for comparability\n\n### LIFO to FIFO Conversion\n\n$$\\text{FIFO inventory} = \\text{LIFO inventory} + \\text{LIFO reserve}$$\n\n$$\\text{FIFO COGS} = \\text{LIFO COGS} - \\Delta\\text{LIFO reserve}$$\n\n$$\\text{FIFO net income} \\approx \\text{LIFO net income} + \\Delta\\text{LIFO reserve} \\times (1-t)$$"

This artificially:\n- Reduces COGS (old low costs flow through)\n- Increases gross profit and net income\n- Increases tax expense\n\nAnalysts watch for LIFO liquidation because the income boost is **non-recurring** and reduces the company's tax shield.\n\n### Key IFRS vs GAAP Difference\n\nIFRS **prohibits LIFO**. This is one of the most significant inventory differences between the frameworks."

      "answer": "$620,000. FIFO inventory = LIFO inventory + LIFO reserve = $500,000 + $120,000 = $620,000. The LIFO reserve represents the cumulative difference between FIFO and LIFO inventory values. Under FIFO, inventory reflects more recent (and during inflation, higher) costs."
