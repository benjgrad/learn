This discount represents additional interest the bondholder earns over the bond's life \u2014 the difference between total coupon payments and the issue price."

The net pension asset/liability = Plan assets - Projected benefit obligation. Remeasurements go to OCI under IFRS; US GAAP is similar."

Under the **cost method** (most common):\n- Debit Treasury Stock (contra-equity) at repurchase cost\n- Treasury stock **reduces** total equity\n\n### Example\n\nRepurchase 10,000 shares at $30 each:\n- Treasury stock: 10,000 \u00d7 $30 = $300,000 (reduces equity)\n\nIf later reissued at $35:\n- Cash: 10,000 \u00d7 $35 = $350,000\n- Treasury stock removed: $300,000\n- APIC increases by: $50,000\n\nIf reissued below cost (at $25):\n- Cash: $250,000\n- Treasury stock removed: $300,000\n- APIC or Retained earnings reduced by: $50,000\n\nTreasury shares are **not outstanding** \u2014 they receive no dividends and have no voting rights."

      "question": "A premium bond has a carrying amount of $1,050 at the start of the year, a coupon rate of 7%, face value of $1,000, and an effective interest rate of 5%. What is interest expense for the year, and does the carrying amount increase or decrease?",
      "answer": "Interest expense = $1,050 \u00d7 5% = $52.50. Coupon payment = $1,000 \u00d7 7% = $70.00. Since the coupon exceeds interest expense, the premium amortizes by $70.00 - $52.50 = $17.50. The carrying amount decreases to $1,050 - $17.50 = $1,032.50. For a premium bond, the carrying amount declines toward par over time."
