(e.g., equity valuation, credit analysis)\n2. **Gather data** \u2014 Collect financial statements, notes, MD&A, industry data, and peer comparisons\n3. **Process the data** \u2014 Calculate ratios, prepare common-size statements, build models\n4. **Analyze and interpret** \u2014 Draw conclusions about profitability, liquidity, solvency, and growth\n5. **Report conclusions** \u2014 Communicate findings with supporting evidence\n6. **Update the analysis** \u2014 Revisit as new information becomes available\n\n### Roles of Financial Statement Analysis\n\n| User | Primary Interest |\n|---|---|\n| Equity analysts | Valuation, earnings quality, growth prospects |\n| Credit analysts | Ability to service debt, default risk |\n| Management | Performance evaluation, strategic planning |\n| Regulators | Compliance, financial stability |\n| Auditors | Fair presentation, material misstatement |"

      "question": "A company changes its revenue recognition policy from recognizing revenue at shipment to recognizing revenue upon customer acceptance. Where would an analyst find disclosure of this change and its impact?",
      "answer": "In the notes to the financial statements. Accounting policy changes must be disclosed in the notes, including the nature of the change, the reason for the change, and its effect on reported amounts. The MD&A may also discuss the change, and the auditor's report may include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph highlighting it. The notes are the primary and most detailed source."
