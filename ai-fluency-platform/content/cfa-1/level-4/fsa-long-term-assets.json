Analysts adjust by examining the ratio of capex to total assets and comparing capitalization policies across peers."

      "question": "A machine costs $200,000 with a residual value of $20,000 and a useful life of 10 years. After 6 years of straight-line depreciation, indicators of impairment arise. The machine's fair value is $50,000 and its undiscounted future cash flows are $95,000. Is an impairment recognized under US GAAP?",
      "answer": "No impairment under US GAAP. After 6 years, carrying amount = $200,000 - 6 \u00d7 ($200,000 - $20,000)/10 = $200,000 - $108,000 = $92,000. Under US GAAP Step 1, compare carrying amount ($92,000) to undiscounted future cash flows ($95,000). Since $95,000 > $92,000, the asset passes the recoverability test and no impairment is recognized. Under IFRS, however, the recoverable amount ($50,000 fair value, assuming value in use is lower) is below carrying amount ($92,000), so a $42,000 impairment would be recognized."

In Year 1, this increases total assets (the cost appears on the balance sheet) and increases net income (only a partial depreciation charge hits the income statement instead of the full cost). CFO is also higher because the cash outflow is classified as investing, not operating. Option A describes the effects of expensing, not capitalizing. Option C is incorrect because capitalizing increases (not decreases) CFO \u2014 the cash outflow shifts from operating to investing activities.",
