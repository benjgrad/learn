      "question": "A company has net income of $2 million and 1 million weighted average shares outstanding. It also has 100,000 stock options with an exercise price of $60 when the market price is $40. What is diluted EPS?",
      "answer": "Diluted EPS equals basic EPS of $2.00. The options are out-of-the-money (exercise price $60 > market price $40), so they are anti-dilutive and excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. Dilutive securities must reduce EPS; if including them would increase EPS, they are anti-dilutive and ignored."
