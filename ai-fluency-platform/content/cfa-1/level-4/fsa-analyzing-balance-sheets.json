It is tested for **impairment** at least annually.\n\n| Feature | IFRS | US GAAP |\n|---|---|---|\n| Impairment test | Two-step: compare recoverable amount to carrying amount | One-step (post-2017 simplification): compare fair value of reporting unit to carrying amount |\n| Reversal of impairment | Not permitted | Not permitted |\n\nA goodwill impairment charge reduces reported assets and net income, often signaling that an acquisition has not performed as expected."

      "question": "A company carries a patent on its balance sheet at $2 million (net of amortization). A competitor develops a superior technology making the patent nearly worthless. What adjustment is required under both IFRS and US GAAP?",
      "answer": "An impairment charge must be recognized. Under both frameworks, if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount (IFRS) or its fair value (US GAAP), the asset must be written down. The difference is recognized as an impairment loss on the income statement, reducing both the asset's carrying value and net income. Under IFRS, the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Under US GAAP, a recoverability test (undiscounted cash flows) is performed first, and if failed, the asset is written down to fair value."

It also records $500M in liabilities assumed. The net impact on the acquirer's equity is the $800M purchase price."
