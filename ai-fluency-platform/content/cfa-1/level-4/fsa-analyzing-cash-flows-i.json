It answers: where did cash come from, and where did it go?\n\n### Three Sections\n\n| Section | Cash Flows From | Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Operating (CFO)** | Day-to-day business activities | Cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers, wages, taxes |\n| **Investing (CFI)** | Long-term asset transactions | Purchase/sale of PP&E, acquisitions, purchase/sale of investments |\n| **Financing (CFF)** | Capital structure changes | Issuing/repaying debt, issuing/repurchasing equity, dividends paid |\n\n$$\\Delta\\text{Cash} = \\text{CFO} + \\text{CFI} + \\text{CFF}$$\n\n### Why Cash Flow Matters\n\n- Net income includes **non-cash items** (depreciation, amortization, unrealized gains/losses)\n- Accrual accounting allows timing differences between revenue recognition and cash receipt\n- A profitable company can go bankrupt if it runs out of cash\n- Cash flow is harder to manipulate than earnings"

Examples:\n- Acquiring assets by assuming liabilities\n- Converting debt to equity\n- Exchanging non-cash assets"

      "question": "A company reports net income of $100,000 and depreciation of $20,000. During the year, accounts receivable increased by $15,000 and accounts payable decreased by $10,000. What is CFO using the indirect method?",
      "answer": "$95,000. Start with net income ($100,000), add back depreciation (+$20,000), subtract the increase in accounts receivable (-$15,000 \u2014 cash not yet collected), and subtract the decrease in accounts payable (-$10,000 \u2014 the company paid down more than it accrued). CFO = $100,000 + $20,000 - $15,000 - $10,000 = $95,000."
