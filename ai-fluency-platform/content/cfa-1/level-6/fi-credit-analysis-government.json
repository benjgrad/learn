Unlike corporations, sovereigns cannot be forced into bankruptcy \u2014 default is a political decision as much as a financial one.\n\n### Key Assessment Areas\n\n| Factor | Key Questions |\n|---|---|\n| **Institutional assessment** | Quality of governance, rule of law, transparency, policy predictability, control of corruption |\n| **Economic assessment** | GDP growth prospects, income per capita, diversification, competitiveness, labor market flexibility |\n| **Fiscal assessment** | Debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal balance, interest burden, revenue flexibility, expenditure rigidity |\n| **Monetary assessment** | Central bank independence, inflation record, exchange rate regime, monetary policy credibility |\n| **External vulnerability** | Current account balance, foreign currency reserves, external debt, dependence on commodity exports |\n\n### Ability vs. Willingness\n\n- **Ability to pay**: Determined by economic strength, fiscal capacity, and access to financing\n- **Willingness to pay**: Determined by political factors, governance quality, and historical track record\n\nSome countries default despite having the resources to pay (willingness issue), while others avoid default through extraordinary measures even in difficult conditions."

      "question": "Why is a sovereign that borrows in its own currency generally considered lower credit risk than one that borrows in a foreign currency?",
      "answer": "A sovereign borrowing in its own currency has the option to print money to service its debt (through its central bank), making technical default on domestic-currency debt extremely unlikely. The risk shifts to inflation/currency depreciation rather than outright default. A sovereign borrowing in foreign currency cannot print the foreign currency and must earn or borrow it, creating genuine default risk if foreign exchange reserves are insufficient or if access to international capital markets is disrupted."

The **primary balance** (fiscal balance excluding interest) must be positive enough to prevent debt from growing faster than GDP.\n\n### Debt Sustainability Condition\n\n$$\\text{Required Primary Surplus} = (r - g) \\times d$$\n\nwhere $r$ = effective interest rate on debt, $g$ = nominal GDP growth rate, $d$ = debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nIf $r > g$, the sovereign must run a primary surplus to stabilize debt. If $g > r$, the sovereign can run a primary deficit and still see the debt ratio decline."

      "content": "## Monetary Flexibility and External Vulnerability\n\n### Monetary Assessment\n\n- **Independent central bank**: Can set monetary policy independently of fiscal pressures; associated with lower inflation and better credit outcomes\n- **Exchange rate regime**: Floating rates provide a shock absorber; fixed rates limit monetary flexibility\n- **Reserve currency status**: Countries with reserve currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) have greater financing flexibility\n- **Inflation record**: History of price stability signals monetary credibility\n\n### External Vulnerability\n\n- **Current account deficit**: Large persistent deficits indicate reliance on foreign financing\n- **Foreign currency reserves**: Adequate reserves provide a buffer against external shocks\n- **External debt**: High external debt (especially short-term) increases vulnerability to capital flight\n- **Commodity dependence**: Revenue volatility if the economy relies on a few export commodities\n\n### Event Risk\n\nSovereign credit can be disrupted by **event risks**: political instability, war, natural disasters, banking crises, or sudden shifts in commodity prices. These are difficult to predict and can rapidly alter a sovereign's credit profile."

      "solution": "**Scenario 1: GDP growth = 3%**\n\n$$\\text{Required Primary Surplus} = (r - g) \\times d = (0.04 - 0.03) \\times 0.80 = 0.01 \\times 0.80 = 0.008 = 0.8\\% \\text{ of GDP}$$\n\nThe government must run a primary surplus of at least 0.8% of GDP to prevent the debt ratio from rising.\n\n**Scenario 2: GDP growth = 5%**\n\n$$\\text{Required Primary Surplus} = (0.04 - 0.05) \\times 0.80 = (-0.01) \\times 0.80 = -0.8\\% \\text{ of GDP}$$\n\nThe negative result means the country can run a primary **deficit** of up to 0.8% of GDP and the debt ratio will still decline. When $g > r$, the economy is growing fast enough to naturally reduce the debt burden."
