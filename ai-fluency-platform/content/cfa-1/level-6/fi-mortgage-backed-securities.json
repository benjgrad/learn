Each investor receives a proportional share of:\n- Monthly interest payments (net of servicing fee)\n- Scheduled principal payments\n- **Prepayments** (unscheduled principal)\n\n**Weighted Average Coupon (WAC)**: The weighted average of the mortgage rates in the pool.\n\n**Weighted Average Maturity (WAM)**: The weighted average remaining term of the mortgages.\n\nThe **pass-through rate** (coupon to investors) = WAC \u2212 Servicing fee \u2212 Guarantee fee."

      "question": "A mortgage pass-through has a WAC of 5.50% and a pass-through rate of 5.00%. What accounts for the 0.50% difference?",
      "answer": "The 0.50% difference represents the servicing fee and guarantee fee. The servicer (who collects mortgage payments and manages delinquencies) receives a portion (e.g., 0.25%), and the guarantor (e.g., Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) receives a guarantee fee (e.g., 0.25%) for providing their credit guarantee. Together, these fees reduce the interest passed through to investors from the 5.50% WAC to the 5.00% pass-through rate."

Borrowers prepay mortgages due to:\n- **Refinancing** (rates fall \u2192 biggest driver)\n- **Home sales** (relocation, upgrading/downsizing)\n- **Curtailments** (extra principal payments)\n- **Defaults** (insured mortgages: insurance pays off the loan)\n\n### Prepayment Measures\n\n**Single Monthly Mortality (SMM)**: The percentage of the remaining pool balance that prepays in a given month.\n\n$$\\text{SMM} = \\frac{\\text{Prepayment in month}}{\\text{Beginning balance} - \\text{Scheduled principal}}$$\n\n**Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR)**: The annualized prepayment rate.\n\n$$\\text{CPR} = 1 - (1 - \\text{SMM})^{12}$$\n\n$$\\text{SMM} = 1 - (1 - \\text{CPR})^{1/12}$$\n\n### PSA Prepayment Model\n\nThe **Public Securities Association (PSA)** benchmark assumes:\n- CPR starts at 0.2% in month 1 and increases by 0.2% per month\n- CPR reaches 6% in month 30 and remains at 6% thereafter\n\n**100% PSA** = the benchmark. **200% PSA** = double the benchmark (CPR reaches 12% in month 30). **50% PSA** = half the benchmark."

      "content": "## CMO Structures\n\n**Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)** redistribute the cash flows from a mortgage pool into tranches with different prepayment risk profiles.\n\n### Sequential-Pay CMO\n\nPrincipal payments (scheduled + prepayments) go to **Tranche A first** until it is fully retired, then to **Tranche B**, then **Tranche C**, etc. All tranches receive their coupon interest simultaneously.\n\n- Early tranches have shorter average lives and bear more prepayment risk\n- Later tranches are protected from prepayment until earlier tranches are retired\n\n### Planned Amortization Class (PAC) Tranches\n\n**PAC tranches** have a **predetermined principal payment schedule** that holds as long as actual prepayments fall within a specified band (e.g., 100-300% PSA).\n\n- **PAC tranche**: Stable, predictable cash flows (like a corporate bond)\n- **Support (companion) tranche**: Absorbs prepayment variability. When prepayments are fast, the support tranche receives excess principal. When prepayments are slow, the support tranche receives less.\n\n### IO and PO Strips\n\n- **Interest-Only (IO) strip**: Receives only interest. Benefits when rates **rise** (slower prepayments \u2192 more interest over longer period). Falls in value when rates fall.\n- **Principal-Only (PO) strip**: Receives only principal. Benefits when rates **fall** (faster prepayments \u2192 principal returned sooner at full value). Falls in value when rates rise.\n\nIO and PO strips have **opposite interest rate sensitivities**, making them useful hedging tools."
