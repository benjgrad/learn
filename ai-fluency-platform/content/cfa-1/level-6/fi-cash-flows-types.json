      "content": "## Bullet, Amortizing, and Sinking Fund Bonds\n\n### Bullet Bonds\n\nA **bullet bond** pays only coupon interest during its life and returns the entire par value at maturity. This is the most common bond structure. The investor faces **concentration risk** because 100% of principal is returned at one point.\n\n### Amortizing Bonds\n\nAn **amortizing bond** repays principal gradually through periodic payments that include both interest and principal. Each payment is identical (like a mortgage), but the split between interest and principal changes over time:\n\n- Early payments: mostly interest\n- Later payments: mostly principal\n\n$$\\text{Payment} = \\frac{r \\times PV}{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}$$\n\nA **partially amortizing** bond repays some principal over its life but has a **balloon payment** at maturity for the remaining balance.\n\n### Sinking Fund Provisions\n\nA **sinking fund** requires the issuer to retire a portion of the bond issue on a schedule (e.g., 10% per year). The issuer either:\n1. Makes cash payments to the trustee to retire bonds at par, or\n2. Purchases bonds in the open market (if trading below par)\n\nSinking funds **reduce credit risk** for investors (less principal outstanding) but create **reinvestment risk** (principal returned early may be reinvested at lower rates)."

      "question": "An amortizing bond and a bullet bond have identical coupons, maturities, and credit quality. Which has a longer duration?",
      "answer": "The bullet bond has a longer duration. Because the amortizing bond returns principal throughout its life, its weighted-average time to receive cash flows is shorter. The bullet bond concentrates principal repayment at maturity, extending the average time of cash flows. This also means the bullet bond is more sensitive to interest rate changes."

      "content": "## Floating-Rate Notes and Inflation-Linked Bonds\n\n### Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs)\n\nFRN coupons reset periodically based on a reference rate plus a fixed **quoted margin**. Because the coupon adjusts with market rates, FRNs have very low interest rate risk \u2014 their price stays near par at each reset date.\n\nIf the issuer's credit quality changes, the **required margin** (what investors demand) may differ from the quoted margin:\n\n- Required margin > Quoted margin \u2192 FRN trades below par (credit deteriorated)\n- Required margin < Quoted margin \u2192 FRN trades above par (credit improved)\n- Required margin = Quoted margin \u2192 FRN trades at par\n\n### Inflation-Linked Bonds (e.g., TIPS)\n\nThe principal of a **Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS)** adjusts with CPI:\n\n$$\\text{Adjusted Principal} = \\text{Par Value} \\times \\frac{\\text{CPI}_{\\text{current}}}{\\text{CPI}_{\\text{base}}}$$\n\nCoupons are calculated on the **adjusted principal**, so both coupon payments and the final principal increase with inflation. The **real yield** is the stated coupon rate; the **nominal return** includes inflation adjustment."

    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "## Payment-in-Kind and Structured Notes\n\n### Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Bonds\n\nPIK bonds allow the issuer to pay interest by issuing additional bonds (or increasing the outstanding principal) instead of making cash payments. These are common in **leveraged buyouts** and high-yield situations where the issuer needs to conserve cash in early years. PIK bonds carry higher credit risk because the issuer's debt burden grows over time.\n\n### Structured Notes\n\nStructured notes combine a bond with a **derivative** component to create customized payoff profiles:\n\n- **Inverse floaters**: Coupon moves inversely to the reference rate (e.g., 10% \u2212 SOFR)\n- **Range accrual notes**: Coupon accrues only when a reference rate stays within a defined range\n- **Credit-linked notes**: Return is linked to the credit performance of a reference entity\n\nStructured notes allow investors to express specific market views but typically involve higher complexity and less liquidity than plain vanilla bonds."

      "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the inflation-adjusted principal.\n\n$$\\text{Adjusted Principal} = \\$1{,}000 \\times \\frac{283.5}{280} = \\$1{,}000 \\times 1.0125 = \\$1{,}012.50$$\n\nStep 2: Apply the semiannual coupon rate to the adjusted principal.\n\n$$\\text{Coupon} = \\$1{,}012.50 \\times \\frac{2\\%}{2} = \\$1{,}012.50 \\times 0.01 = \\$10.125$$\n\nThe coupon is $10.125, which is higher than the $10.00 it would have been without inflation adjustment. Both the coupon and eventual principal repayment grow with inflation."
