      "question": "A 182-day T-bill has a bank discount yield of 5.00%. Is its bond equivalent yield higher or lower than 5.00%?",
      "answer": "Higher. The BEY is always higher than the bank discount yield for two reasons: (1) the BEY uses the actual purchase price (which is less than par) as the denominator, increasing the yield, and (2) it uses a 365-day year instead of 360. Using the formula: BEY = (365 \u00d7 0.05) / (360 \u2212 (0.05 \u00d7 182)) = 18.25/350.9 = 5.20%. The BEY is a more accurate measure of the investor's return."

Typically high credit quality (AAA), issued in major currencies, and used to fund development projects."

      "content": "## Municipal Bonds\n\nMunicipal bonds (\"munis\") are issued by U.S. state and local governments. Their key feature is **tax-exempt interest income** for federal (and often state/local) taxes.\n\n### Types\n\n- **General obligation (GO) bonds**: Backed by the taxing power of the issuer; no specific revenue source pledged\n- **Revenue bonds**: Backed by revenue from a specific project (toll road, airport, hospital); no taxing power pledged\n\n### Tax-Equivalent Yield\n\nTo compare a tax-exempt muni yield to a taxable bond yield:\n\n$$\\text{Tax-Equivalent Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Muni Yield}}{1 - \\text{Marginal Tax Rate}}$$\n\n### Example\n\nA muni bond yields 3.50%. An investor's marginal tax rate is 35%.\n\n$$\\text{TEY} = \\frac{3.50\\%}{1 - 0.35} = \\frac{3.50\\%}{0.65} = 5.38\\%$$\n\nThe investor needs a taxable bond yielding at least 5.38% to match the after-tax return of the 3.50% muni. Munis are most attractive to investors in **high tax brackets**."
