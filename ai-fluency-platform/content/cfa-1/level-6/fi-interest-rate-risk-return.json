      "content": "## Three Sources of Bond Return\n\nAn investor's total return from a fixed-rate bond has three components:\n\n### 1. Coupon Income\nThe periodic coupon payments received. This is known and fixed for a fixed-rate bond.\n\n### 2. Reinvestment Income\nThe interest earned on reinvested coupons. This is **uncertain** because future reinvestment rates are unknown. If rates rise, reinvestment income exceeds initial expectations. If rates fall, reinvestment income falls short.\n\n### 3. Capital Gain or Loss\nThe change in the bond's price from purchase to sale (or maturity). If held to maturity, the price converges to par (pull to par). If sold before maturity, the price depends on current yields.\n\n### The Reinvestment Assumption of YTM\n\nYTM assumes all coupons are reinvested at the YTM rate. The **realized return** will differ from YTM if:\n- Reinvestment rates differ from YTM\n- The bond is sold before maturity at a different yield\n\nFor a bond held to maturity: Realized return = YTM **only if** all coupons are reinvested at YTM. The longer the maturity and the higher the coupon, the greater the reinvestment risk."

      "question": "A 20-year, 8% coupon bond yields 8% (priced at par). Which component of return is most significant: coupon income, reinvestment income, or capital gain/loss?",
      "answer": "Reinvestment income is the most significant component for a long-maturity, high-coupon bond. Over 20 years, the investor receives $160 in coupon payments ($8 \u00d7 20) on a $100 investment. But if all coupons are reinvested at 8%, the accumulated value of reinvested coupons is approximately $494 \u00d7 ($8 annuity factor at 8% for 20 years minus the $160 in coupons). The reinvestment income (interest on reinvested coupons) far exceeds the simple coupon payments. There is no capital gain because the bond was purchased at par and redeems at par."

After 3 years, yields have fallen to 4%. The investor sells.\n\n- Coupons received and reinvested: Assume reinvestment at 5% average\n  - Year 1 coupon reinvested 2 years: $6 \u00d7 (1.05)\u00b2 = $6.615$\n  - Year 2 coupon reinvested 1 year: $6 \u00d7 1.05 = $6.30$\n  - Year 3 coupon (just received): $6.00$\n  - Total coupon + reinvestment: $18.915$\n- Sale price of remaining 2-year bond at 4% YTM: $6/1.04 + $106/1.04\u00b2 = $5.769 + $97.985 = $103.754$\n\n$$\\text{HPR} = \\frac{103.754 + 18.915 - 100}{100} = 22.67\\%$$\n\nAnnualized: $(1.2267)^{1/3} - 1 = 7.06\\%$ per year."

          "explanation": "When the holding period (4 years) is shorter than the Macaulay duration (6 years), price risk dominates. The investor will sell the bond before maturity, and the sale price is sensitive to yield changes. A rate increase causes a capital loss that exceeds the gain from higher reinvestment income.
