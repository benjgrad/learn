      "answer": "Lower. When a bond trades at a premium (above par at 102), its YTM is below its coupon rate. The buyer pays more than face value, reducing the effective yield. Conversely, discount bonds have YTM above their coupon rate."

This inverse relationship is fundamental to fixed income investing.\n\n| When yields... | Bond prices... | Why? |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rise | Fall | Future cash flows are discounted at a higher rate |\n| Fall | Rise | Future cash flows are discounted at a lower rate |\n\n### Price Sensitivity\n\nNot all bonds react equally to yield changes:\n\n- **Longer maturity** = greater price sensitivity (more cash flows affected)\n- **Lower coupon rate** = greater price sensitivity (more value in the distant par payment)\n- **Lower initial yield** = greater price sensitivity (convexity effect)\n\nThis sensitivity is formally measured by **duration**, which we'll cover in the next module."

Specifically: Zero-coupon: old price = 100/1.05\u00b2 = $90.70, new price = 100/1.06\u00b2 = $89.00, decline = 1.87%.
