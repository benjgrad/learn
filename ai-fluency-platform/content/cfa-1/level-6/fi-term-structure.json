The spot rate curve is the foundation for bond pricing:\n\n$$P = \\frac{C}{(1+z_1)} + \\frac{C}{(1+z_2)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{C + F}{(1+z_n)^n}$$\n\n**Forward rates** ($f_{t_1,t_2}$) are implied future interest rates derived from spot rates. The forward rate from year 1 to year 2 is:\n\n$$f_{1,1} = \\frac{(1+z_2)^2}{(1+z_1)} - 1$$\n\nMore generally, the $k$-period forward rate starting at time $t$:\n\n$$(1+z_{t+k})^{t+k} = (1+z_t)^t \\times (1+f_{t,k})^k$$"

      "answer": "Higher than 4%. The forward rate must be high enough so that investing for 1 year at 3% and then 1 year at the forward rate gives the same result as investing for 2 years at 4%. Solving: (1.03)(1 + f) = (1.04)\u00b2, so f = (1.04)\u00b2/1.03 \u2212 1 = 1.0816/1.03 \u2212 1 = 5.01%.

      "content": "## Theories of the Term Structure\n\n### Pure Expectations Theory\n\nForward rates are **unbiased predictors** of future spot rates. The yield curve shape reflects only market expectations for future rates \u2014 no risk premium. An upward-sloping curve means the market expects rates to rise.\n\n**Limitation**: Ignores the fact that investors typically demand compensation for the uncertainty of lending over longer periods.\n\n### Liquidity Preference Theory\n\nInvestors demand a **liquidity premium** for holding longer-term bonds because of their greater price risk. Forward rates = expected future spot rates + a liquidity premium. This theory predicts a positive bias toward upward-sloping curves.\n\n$$f_{t,1} = E(z_{t,1}) + L_t$$\n\nwhere $L_t > 0$ and increasing with maturity.\n\n### Market Segmentation Theory\n\nBorrowers and lenders have **preferred maturity ranges** and will not easily shift between segments. Supply and demand within each segment independently determines rates for that maturity. This explains why different parts of the curve can move independently.\n\n### Preferred Habitat Theory\n\nInvestors have preferred maturities but **will shift** if offered a sufficient yield premium. This combines elements of expectations theory and segmentation \u2014 rates are determined by expectations plus term premiums that can vary across maturities."
