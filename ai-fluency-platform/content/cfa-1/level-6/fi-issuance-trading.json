      "content": "## Primary Market: Bringing Bonds to Market\n\nThe **primary market** is where new bonds are sold for the first time.\n\n### Corporate Bond Issuance\n\nCorporate bonds are typically issued through **underwriting**:\n\n- **Firm commitment**: The underwriter (investment bank) buys the entire issue and resells it. The underwriter bears the risk of unsold bonds.\n- **Best efforts**: The underwriter sells as much as possible but does not guarantee the full amount. The issuer bears the risk.\n- **Book building**: The underwriter surveys institutional investors to gauge demand and determine the offering price/yield spread.\n\nA **shelf registration** (SEC Rule 415) allows issuers to register a large amount of securities and sell them in portions over time, reducing issuance costs.\n\n### Government Bond Issuance\n\nGovernment bonds are typically issued through **auctions**:\n\n- **Single-price auction** (uniform price): All winning bidders pay the same price (the highest yield accepted). Used by the U.S. Treasury.\n- **Multiple-price auction**: Each winning bidder pays their own bid price.\n\nIn a U.S. Treasury auction, **competitive bidders** specify the yield they will accept, while **non-competitive bidders** agree to accept whatever yield is determined by the auction."

      "question": "In a firm commitment underwriting, who bears the risk if investor demand is lower than expected?",
      "answer": "The underwriter (investment bank) bears the risk. In a firm commitment, the underwriter purchases the entire bond issue from the issuer at a set price and then resells the bonds to investors. If demand is insufficient, the underwriter is stuck holding unsold bonds at a potential loss. This is why the underwriter's spread (difference between purchase and resale price) compensates for this risk."

      "content": "## Secondary Market and Settlement\n\n### Secondary Market Trading\n\nMost bonds trade in the **over-the-counter (OTC)** market through dealer networks rather than on centralized exchanges. Key features:\n\n- **Dealer market**: Dealers quote bid and ask prices and trade from their own inventory\n- **Electronic platforms**: Increasingly used for price discovery and execution (e.g., MarketAxess, Tradeweb)\n- **Liquidity varies**: Government bonds are highly liquid; corporate and municipal bonds are often illiquid\n\n### Settlement\n\nBond settlement specifies when the buyer pays and the seller delivers:\n\n| Market | Settlement Convention |\n|---|---|\n| U.S. Treasuries | T+1 (one business day after trade) |\n| U.S. Corporate | T+1 |\n| U.S. Municipal | T+2 |\n\n### Clearing\n\nA **central clearinghouse** (e.g., DTCC in the U.S.) acts as the counterparty to both sides of a trade, reducing **counterparty risk**. The clearinghouse guarantees settlement even if one party defaults."

      "content": "## Repurchase Agreements (Repos)\n\nA **repurchase agreement (repo)** is a short-term collateralized borrowing arrangement:\n\n1. The **seller** (borrower) sells a security to the **buyer** (lender) and agrees to repurchase it at a higher price on a specified date\n2. The price difference is the **repo rate** (the interest cost)\n\n$$\\text{Repurchase Price} = \\text{Sale Price} \\times \\left(1 + \\text{Repo Rate} \\times \\frac{\\text{Days}}{360}\\right)$$\n\n### Key Repo Concepts\n\n- **Repo rate** is influenced by the quality of collateral, term of the repo, and general interest rate levels\n- **Haircut**: The collateral's market value exceeds the loan amount (e.g., $102 of bonds for $100 cash), protecting the lender\n- **Overnight repo**: Matures the next business day\n- **Term repo**: Matures in more than one day\n- The **reverse repo** is the same transaction from the lender's perspective\n\nRepos are critical for short-term funding, monetary policy implementation, and bond market liquidity."

      "solution": "Using the repo price formula:\n\n$$\\text{Repurchase Price} = \\$10{,}050{,}000 \\times \\left(1 + 0.048 \\times \\frac{30}{360}\\right)$$\n\n$$= \\$10{,}050{,}000 \\times (1 + 0.004)$$\n\n$$= \\$10{,}050{,}000 \\times 1.004 = \\$10{,}090{,}200$$\n\nThe repo interest = $10,090,200 \u2212 $10,050,000 = $40,200.
