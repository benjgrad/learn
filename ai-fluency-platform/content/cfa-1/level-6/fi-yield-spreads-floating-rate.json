But the market's **required margin** (also called the **discount margin**) changes over time based on the issuer's credit quality and market conditions.\n\n### Pricing Relationships\n\n| Condition | Price vs. Par | Reason |\n|---|---|---|\n| Required margin = Quoted margin | At par | Investor receives exactly the spread they demand |\n| Required margin > Quoted margin | Below par (discount) | Investor demands more spread than the bond provides |\n| Required margin < Quoted margin | Above par (premium) | Bond provides more spread than currently required |\n\n### FRN Valuation\n\nThe price of an FRN can be calculated by discounting future cash flows using the required margin:\n\n$$P = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{(\\text{Reference Rate} + QM) \\times \\frac{FV}{m}}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\text{Reference Rate} + DM}{m}\\right)^t} + \\frac{FV}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\text{Reference Rate} + DM}{m}\\right)^N}$$\n\nwhere $m$ = number of periods per year, $DM$ = discount margin, and $N$ = remaining periods. On a **reset date**, if QM = DM, the FRN resets to par."

      "question": "An FRN has a quoted margin of 200 bps. Currently, similar-quality FRNs are being issued with margins of 250 bps. Will this FRN trade above or below par?",
      "answer": "Below par. The required margin (250 bps) exceeds the quoted margin (200 bps), meaning the FRN pays 50 bps less spread than the market currently demands for this credit quality. Investors will only buy it at a discount to compensate for the below-market spread. The FRN's price will be below 100."

      "content": "## Discount Margin\n\nThe **discount margin (DM)** is the spread over the reference rate that equates the FRN's expected cash flows to its current market price. It is the FRN equivalent of the Z-spread for fixed-rate bonds.\n\n### Calculating Discount Margin\n\nFor a simplified approach, assuming the reference rate remains constant:\n\n$$DM \\approx QM + \\frac{(100 - P)}{N \\times P} \\times m \\times 100$$\n\nwhere $P$ = current price per 100 par, $N$ = remaining periods, $m$ = periods per year.\n\nMore precisely, DM is found iteratively \u2014 it is the constant spread added to the reference rate at which discounted cash flows equal the market price.\n\n### Interpreting Discount Margin\n\n- DM > QM \u2192 Bond trades below par (credit deterioration or wider market spreads)\n- DM < QM \u2192 Bond trades above par (credit improvement or tighter spreads)\n- DM = QM \u2192 Bond trades at par\n\nThe discount margin captures the **total return spread** the investor earns over the reference rate."

      "content": "## Risks of Floating-Rate Notes\n\nFRNs are often perceived as low-risk, but they carry specific risks:\n\n### Credit Risk\n\nFRNs carry the same default risk as fixed-rate bonds from the same issuer. A credit rating downgrade will increase the required margin, pushing the FRN price below par. The floating coupon does **not** protect against credit deterioration.\n\n### Spread Risk\n\nEven without a change in credit quality, if market-wide credit spreads widen (e.g., during a financial crisis), the required margin increases and FRN prices fall. This is analogous to credit spread risk for fixed-rate bonds.\n\n### Interest Rate Risk (Limited)\n\nFRNs have **minimal interest rate risk** between reset dates because the coupon adjusts to current rates. However, there is some residual interest rate exposure between reset dates (the coupon is fixed until the next reset). Longer reset periods = slightly more interest rate risk.\n\n### Cap Risk\n\nIf an FRN has a **coupon cap**, the coupon cannot rise above the cap rate even if reference rates increase beyond it. In a rising rate environment, a capped FRN behaves more like a fixed-rate bond once the cap is reached, creating interest rate risk."

      "solution": "Using the simplified discount margin formula:\n\n$$DM \\approx QM + \\frac{(100 - P)}{N \\times P} \\times m \\times 100$$\n\nwhere QM = 1.80%, P = $99.20, N = 8 quarters, m = 4 (quarterly).\n\nWait \u2014 let us use a cleaner approach. The annualized capital gain component:\n\n$$\\frac{(100 - 99.20)}{99.20} \\div 2 \\text{ years} = \\frac{0.80}{99.20 \\times 2} = 0.00403 = 0.403\\%$$\n\n$$DM \\approx 1.80\\% + 0.40\\% \\approx 2.20\\% \\text{ (220 bps)}$$\n\nThe discount margin (approximately 220 bps) exceeds the quoted margin (180 bps) because the FRN trades below par. The 40 bps difference reflects the additional spread earned from the discount (buying at 99.20 and receiving 100 at maturity)."
