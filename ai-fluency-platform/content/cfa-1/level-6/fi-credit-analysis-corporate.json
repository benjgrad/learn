      "content": "## The Four Cs of Credit Analysis\n\n### 1. Capacity\n\n**Capacity** is the issuer's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service its debt. This is the most important C and involves analyzing:\n\n- **Industry analysis**: Growth prospects, competitive dynamics, regulatory environment, cyclicality, barriers to entry\n- **Company fundamentals**: Market position, operating efficiency, revenue diversification, management quality\n- **Financial ratios**: Leverage, coverage, and cash flow metrics (detailed below)\n\n### 2. Collateral\n\n**Collateral** refers to the quality and value of assets backing the debt. More relevant for secured debt and distressed issuers:\n\n- Tangible assets (property, equipment) provide better collateral than intangible assets (goodwill, patents)\n- Asset quality declines in distress (fire sale values < book values)\n\n### 3. Covenants\n\n**Covenants** are contractual terms that protect bondholders:\n- Affirmative: Maintain financial ratios, provide audited financials, maintain insurance\n- Negative: Limit additional debt, restrict dividends, limit asset sales, restrict liens\n\n### 4. Character\n\n**Character** refers to management's integrity, track record, and strategy:\n- History of debt repayment, corporate governance quality\n- Strategic decisions (aggressive acquisitions, shareholder-friendly vs. creditor-friendly actions)"

      "question": "A company has a strong leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA = 2.0x) but its interest coverage ratio (EBITDA/Interest) has been declining for three consecutive years. Is the credit improving or deteriorating?",
      "answer": "The credit is likely deteriorating. While the leverage ratio looks healthy in isolation, the declining interest coverage trend signals that the company's earnings are falling relative to its interest costs. This could indicate deteriorating operating performance, rising interest rates on variable-rate debt, or increasing interest expense from recent debt issuance. Trend analysis is crucial \u2014 a snapshot ratio may look acceptable while the trajectory points to trouble. Credit analysts weight trends heavily alongside absolute levels."

Below 2x would be strong (A-rated); above 5x would indicate significant leverage (BB or below).\n- Interest coverage of 5.6x is healthy \u2014 the company generates 5.6 times the EBITDA needed to cover interest. Below 2x would be concerning.\n- CFO-to-debt of 19.4% is adequate. The company can repay about one-fifth of its debt from annual operating cash flow. Above 25% would be strong; below 10% would be weak.\n\nOverall: This profile is consistent with a **low-investment-grade (BBB)** rating."
