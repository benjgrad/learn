      "content": "## Yield Measures for Fixed-Rate Bonds\n\n### Current Yield\n\n$$\\text{Current Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Coupon}}{\\text{Current Bond Price}}$$\n\nCurrent yield ignores capital gains/losses and the time value of money. It only captures income return.\n\n### Yield to Maturity (YTM)\n\nYTM is the **internal rate of return** assuming the bond is held to maturity and all coupons are reinvested at the YTM. It is the discount rate that equates the PV of all cash flows to the current price:\n\n$$P = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{(1 + \\text{YTM}/2)^t} + \\frac{F}{(1 + \\text{YTM}/2)^n}$$\n\nYTM assumptions: (1) bond held to maturity, (2) no default, (3) all coupons reinvested at YTM. If any assumption fails, the realized return will differ.\n\n### Yield to Call (YTC) and Yield to Worst (YTW)\n\n**YTC** replaces maturity with the first call date and par with the call price:\n\n$$P = \\sum_{t=1}^{n_c} \\frac{C}{(1 + \\text{YTC}/2)^t} + \\frac{\\text{Call Price}}{(1 + \\text{YTC}/2)^{n_c}}$$\n\n**Yield to worst (YTW)** = the lowest of YTM and all possible YTCs. It represents the **minimum potential yield** the investor could receive. For callable bonds trading at a premium, YTW is typically the YTC."

      "question": "A callable bond trades at 105 (above par). Is its yield-to-worst more likely its YTM or its YTC?",
      "answer": "Its YTC. When a callable bond trades at a premium (above the call price), the issuer has an incentive to call the bond and refinance at lower rates. The investor should expect the call to be exercised. The YTC will be lower than the YTM because the investor receives the lower call price (e.g., 100) sooner instead of holding to maturity. Since YTW is the minimum, it equals the YTC in this case."

      "content": "## Yield Conversions\n\n### Semiannual to Annual\n\nU.S. bonds typically quote yields on a **semiannual bond basis (SABB)**. To convert:\n\n$$\\text{Effective Annual Yield (EAY)} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\text{YTM}}{2}\\right)^2 - 1$$\n\n### Example\n\nA bond has a semiannual YTM of 6.00% (i.e., 3.00% per period):\n\n$$\\text{EAY} = (1.03)^2 - 1 = 1.0609 - 1 = 6.09\\%$$\n\nThe EAY exceeds the stated YTM because of compounding.\n\n## Yield Spread Measures\n\n| Spread | Definition | Benchmark |\n|---|---|---|\n| **G-spread** | Yield minus the yield on an interpolated government bond of the same maturity | Government bond yield |\n| **I-spread** | Yield minus the swap rate for the same maturity | Swap rate (e.g., SOFR swap) |\n| **Z-spread** (zero-volatility spread) | Constant spread added to each spot rate on the government curve to match the bond's price | Spot rate curve |\n| **OAS** (option-adjusted spread) | Z-spread minus the cost of any embedded option; reflects credit and liquidity risk only | Spot rate curve (option-adjusted) |\n\nFor option-free bonds: **OAS = Z-spread** (no embedded option to adjust for).\nFor callable bonds: **OAS < Z-spread** (the call option has value to the issuer that must be removed)."
