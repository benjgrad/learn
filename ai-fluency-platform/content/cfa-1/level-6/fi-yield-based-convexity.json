      "content": "## Why Duration Alone Is Not Enough\n\nDuration provides a **linear approximation** of the price-yield relationship. But the actual relationship is **curved** (convex). For small yield changes, duration is accurate. For larger changes, the linear estimate introduces error:\n\n- When yields **fall**, duration **underestimates** the price increase\n- When yields **rise**, duration **overestimates** the price decrease\n\nThis asymmetry benefits bondholders \u2014 they gain more than expected when rates fall and lose less than expected when rates rise. **Convexity** measures this curvature.\n\n## Approximate Convexity\n\n$$\\text{ApproxCon} = \\frac{P_- + P_+ - 2P_0}{(\\Delta y)^2 \\times P_0}$$\n\nwhere $P_-$ = price if yield falls by $\\Delta y$, $P_+$ = price if yield rises by $\\Delta y$, $P_0$ = current price.\n\n### Example\n\nA bond is priced at $100. For a 50 bp yield change: $P_- = $103.40, $P_+ = $96.80.\n\n$$\\text{ApproxCon} = \\frac{103.40 + 96.80 - 200}{(0.005)^2 \\times 100} = \\frac{0.20}{0.0025} = 80.0$$\n\nHigher convexity means more curvature and a greater benefit from the asymmetry."

      "answer": "Bond Y. Higher convexity means greater curvature in the price-yield relationship, so the linear duration estimate will be less accurate for Bond Y. For a large yield change of 200 bps, the convexity adjustment is significant: Bond Y's adjustment = 0.5 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 (0.02)\u00b2 = 2.40%, versus Bond X's adjustment = 0.5 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 (0.02)\u00b2 = 1.00%.

Investors benefit because:\n- Price gains from yield decreases exceed price losses from yield increases of the same magnitude\n- All else equal, investors prefer higher convexity\n\n### Negative Convexity (Callable Bonds)\n\n**Callable bonds** exhibit **negative convexity** at low yields. When yields fall significantly:\n- The bond's price approaches the **call price ceiling** (issuer will call the bond)\n- Further yield decreases produce smaller price gains (price is capped)\n- The price-yield curve bows away from the origin\n\nAt high yields (far from call): callable bond behaves like a straight bond (positive convexity).\nAt low yields (near call): price is capped, creating negative convexity.\n\n### Money Convexity\n\n$$\\text{Money Convexity} = \\text{Convexity} \\times P$$\n\nThis measures the dollar convexity rather than percentage convexity, useful for portfolio risk management."
