      "content": "## The Bond Indenture and Coupon Structures\n\nThe **bond indenture** (or trust deed) is the legal contract between the issuer and bondholders. It specifies all terms: coupon rate, maturity date, par value, covenants, and any embedded options. A **trustee** (typically a bank) is appointed to act on behalf of bondholders.\n\n### Coupon Structures\n\n| Type | Description |\n|---|---|\n| **Fixed-rate** | Coupon is constant for the bond's life (e.g., 5% annually) |\n| **Floating-rate (FRN)** | Coupon resets periodically: Reference rate + Spread (e.g., SOFR + 150 bps) |\n| **Zero-coupon** | No periodic coupons; issued at a discount and redeems at par |\n| **Step-up** | Coupon increases on a predetermined schedule |\n| **Deferred coupon** | No coupons in early years, then begins paying |\n| **Payment-in-kind (PIK)** | Issuer can pay coupons with additional bonds instead of cash |\n\nA floating-rate note coupon is typically calculated as:\n\n$$\\text{Coupon} = \\text{Reference Rate} + \\text{Quoted Margin}$$\n\nFRNs usually have a **reset date** (when the new rate is determined) and a **payment date** (when the coupon is paid). Many FRNs include **caps** (maximum coupon) and **floors** (minimum coupon)."

      "question": "A step-up bond has coupons of 3% for years 1-3 and 5% for years 4-7. If market yields are 4% throughout, does this bond initially trade at a premium or discount?",
      "answer": "It initially trades at a discount. In years 1-3 the coupon (3%) is below the market yield (4%), so the bond is worth less than par during that period. The higher 5% coupons in later years partially offset this, but the early below-market coupons are weighted more heavily in present value terms because they are discounted fewer periods. The overall price depends on the exact PV calculation, but the below-market early coupons pull the price below par at issuance."

      "content": "## Day-Count Conventions and Accrued Interest\n\nWhen a bond is bought between coupon dates, the buyer must compensate the seller for interest earned but not yet paid. This is **accrued interest**.\n\n$$\\text{Accrued Interest} = \\frac{\\text{Days since last coupon}}{\\text{Days in coupon period}} \\times \\text{Coupon Payment}$$\n\nThe **day-count convention** determines how days are counted:\n\n| Convention | Numerator | Denominator | Typical Use |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **30/360** | Assumes 30-day months | 360-day year | U.S. corporate bonds |\n| **Actual/Actual** | Actual days elapsed | Actual days in period | U.S. Treasury bonds |\n| **Actual/360** | Actual days elapsed | 360-day year | Money market instruments |\n\n### Clean vs. Dirty Price\n\n- **Full (dirty) price** = Clean price + Accrued interest\n- **Clean (flat) price** = Quoted price without accrued interest\n\nBond prices are quoted as **clean prices** but settled at **dirty prices**. This prevents coupon payments from creating artificial price jumps in quoted prices."

      "content": "## Embedded Options and Covenants\n\n### Embedded Options\n\nSome bonds contain options that give rights to the issuer or bondholder:\n\n| Option | Holder | Effect on Bond Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Call option** | Issuer | Issuer can redeem early; benefits issuer when rates fall. Reduces value to bondholder \u2192 higher yield |\n| **Put option** | Bondholder | Bondholder can sell back at par; benefits holder when rates rise. Increases value to bondholder \u2192 lower yield |\n| **Conversion option** | Bondholder | Convert bond into issuer's equity. Increases value \u2192 lower yield |\n\nPricing relationships:\n\n$$\\text{Value of callable bond} = \\text{Value of straight bond} - \\text{Value of call option}$$\n$$\\text{Value of putable bond} = \\text{Value of straight bond} + \\text{Value of put option}$$\n\n### Covenants\n\n**Affirmative covenants** require the issuer to do something (e.g., maintain insurance, make timely interest payments, comply with laws). **Negative covenants** restrict the issuer from doing something (e.g., limits on additional debt issuance, restrictions on asset sales, dividend limitations). Covenants protect bondholders by constraining issuer behavior that could increase credit risk."
