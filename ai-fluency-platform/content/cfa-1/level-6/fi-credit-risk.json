      "content": "## Types of Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk encompasses several related but distinct risks:\n\n### Default Risk\nThe risk that the issuer fails to make scheduled interest or principal payments. Default risk is the most severe form of credit risk \u2014 it results in actual loss of cash flows.\n\n### Credit Spread Risk\nThe risk that the yield spread over the benchmark widens, causing the bond's price to fall even without a default. Credit spreads reflect the market's assessment of credit risk and can change due to issuer-specific or market-wide factors.\n\n### Downgrade Risk\nThe risk that a rating agency lowers the issuer's credit rating, which typically triggers spread widening and price declines. Downgrades can also force institutional investors with rating-based mandates to sell.\n\n## Expected Loss\n\nThe **expected loss** on a bond combines the probability and severity of default:\n\n$$\\text{Expected Loss} = \\text{PD} \\times \\text{LGD} \\times \\text{EAD}$$\n\n| Component | Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **PD** (Probability of Default) | Likelihood of default over a specified period |\n| **LGD** (Loss Given Default) | Percentage of exposure lost if default occurs = 1 \u2212 Recovery Rate |\n| **EAD** (Exposure at Default) | Amount owed at the time of default |\n\n### Recovery Rate\n\nThe **recovery rate** is the percentage of the bond's face value that investors receive after default:\n\n$$\\text{LGD} = 1 - \\text{Recovery Rate}$$\n\nRecovery rates vary by seniority: senior secured (~45-65%) > senior unsecured (~35-45%) > subordinated (~15-30%)."

      "question": "A BBB-rated bond has a 2% probability of default over 1 year, a recovery rate of 40%, and an EAD of $10 million. What is the expected loss?",
      "answer": "Expected loss = PD \u00d7 LGD \u00d7 EAD = 0.02 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.40) \u00d7 $10,000,000 = 0.02 \u00d7 0.60 \u00d7 $10,000,000 = $120,000. The LGD is 60% (= 1 \u2212 40% recovery). Even though the default probability is low (2%), the expected loss is meaningful because the LGD (60%) and EAD ($10M) are significant. The actual loss if default occurs would be $6,000,000, but the probability-weighted expected loss is $120,000."

      "content": "## Credit Ratings\n\nRating agencies (Moody's, S&P, Fitch) assess credit quality and assign ratings:\n\n| S&P/Fitch | Moody's | Category |\n|---|---|---|\n| AAA | Aaa | Highest quality |\n| AA+, AA, AA\u2212 | Aa1, Aa2, Aa3 | High quality |\n| A+, A, A\u2212 | A1, A2, A3 | Upper medium grade |\n| BBB+, BBB, BBB\u2212 | Baa1, Baa2, Baa3 | Medium grade (lowest IG) |\n| BB+, BB, BB\u2212 | Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 | Speculative |\n| B+, B, B\u2212 | B1, B2, B3 | Highly speculative |\n| CCC to C | Caa to C | Substantial/extreme risk |\n| D | \u2014 | In default |\n\n### Rating Transitions\n\n**Transition matrices** show the probability of moving between rating categories over a period. Key patterns:\n- Higher-rated bonds have a higher probability of maintaining their rating\n- Downgrades are more common than upgrades\n- The probability of default increases steeply as ratings decline\n- **Fallen angels** (IG to HY) face forced selling and outsized price declines"

      "content": "## Limitations of Credit Ratings\n\nCredit ratings are useful but have important limitations:\n\n- **Lag market pricing**: Ratings change slowly; markets often reprice credit risk before agencies act\n- **Issuer-paid model**: Agencies are paid by issuers, creating potential conflicts of interest\n- **Through-the-cycle approach**: Ratings reflect long-term credit quality, not short-term fluctuations, which can mask deteriorating conditions\n- **Not a guarantee**: A high rating does not guarantee against default (e.g., many AAA-rated CDO tranches defaulted in 2008)\n- **Do not capture all risks**: Ratings focus on default risk, not liquidity risk, interest rate risk, or market-wide spread risk\n\n### Credit Spread Components\n\nThe credit spread a bond trades at reflects:\n1. **Expected loss** (compensation for default probability \u00d7 loss severity)\n2. **Credit risk premium** (compensation for the uncertainty around expected loss)\n3. **Liquidity premium** (compensation for lower liquidity vs. government bonds)"
