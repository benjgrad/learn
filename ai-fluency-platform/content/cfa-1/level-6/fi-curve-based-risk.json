      "question": "A callable bond has an effective duration of 4.2 years. An otherwise identical option-free bond has a modified duration of 7.1 years. Why is the callable bond's effective duration so much lower?",
      "answer": "The call option limits the callable bond's price appreciation when rates fall. As rates decline, the probability of the bond being called increases, effectively shortening the bond's expected life and reducing its sensitivity to rate changes. The effective duration of 4.2 reflects this shortened expected maturity. The option-free bond has no such cap, so its full 7.1-year duration applies. In effect, the call option 'steals' upside from the bondholder, reducing the bond's effective interest rate sensitivity."

      "content": "## Key Rate Duration\n\nPortfolio duration assumes a **parallel shift** in the yield curve. In reality, the curve often shifts non-parallel (e.g., short rates rise while long rates fall).\n\n**Key rate duration** (partial duration) measures a bond's sensitivity to a change at a **specific maturity point** on the yield curve while holding all other rates constant.\n\n$$\\%\\Delta P \\approx \\sum_{k} -\\text{KeyRateDur}_k \\times \\Delta y_k$$\n\nA bond's key rate durations sum to approximately its effective duration. For example, a 10-year bullet bond has most of its key rate duration concentrated at the 10-year point, while a 10-year amortizing bond has key rate exposures spread across multiple maturities.\n\n## Empirical Duration\n\n**Empirical duration** is estimated by running a **regression** of historical bond price changes against changes in a benchmark yield:\n\n$$\\%\\Delta P = \\alpha + \\beta \\times \\Delta y + \\epsilon$$\n\nThe regression coefficient $\\beta$ is the empirical duration. This is useful for bonds that do not respond to yield changes as analytical models predict (e.g., high-yield bonds, whose prices are driven more by credit factors than interest rates)."

For floating-rate notes, spread duration is significant (FRNs are sensitive to spread changes even though they have minimal interest rate duration).\n\n### Portfolio Duration Contribution\n\nA bond's **contribution to portfolio duration** measures how much it contributes to the overall portfolio's interest rate sensitivity:\n\n$$\\text{Contribution}_i = w_i \\times \\text{EffDur}_i$$\n\nwhere $w_i$ = market value weight of bond $i$ in the portfolio.\n\nPortfolio managers use duration contributions to understand which positions drive portfolio risk and to make targeted adjustments."

          "explanation": "The 10-year callable municipal bond has an embedded option that changes its expected cash flows when interest rates change. Modified duration assumes fixed cash flows and cannot capture the call option's effect on price sensitivity. Effective duration uses a model that revalues the bond under different rate scenarios, properly accounting for the changing probability of the call being exercised.

The bullet bond has most of its key rate duration concentrated at the 10-year point, making it highly sensitive to the rise in long rates. The amortizing bond has key rate durations spread across multiple maturities, benefiting from the falling short rates and partially offsetting the rising long rates.
