      "question": "A CFA charterholder sees a colleague at another firm making misleading claims about their fund's performance in marketing materials. Under the Code of Ethics, does the charterholder have any obligation regarding this colleague's behavior?",
      "answer": "Yes. Principle 4 of the Code states that members should 'practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner.' While the charterholder cannot directly control the colleague's behavior, the Code creates an obligation to promote ethical conduct in the profession more broadly \u2014 which could include reporting the behavior to the colleague's compliance department or to CFA Institute."

      "solution": "**(a) Standard I(C) \u2014 Misrepresentation.** Presenting another's work as your own is a clear misrepresentation. This includes plagiarism of models, reports, or analysis.\n\n**(b) Standard III(D) \u2014 Performance Presentation.** While the 15% return may be factual, omitting benchmark context makes the presentation misleading. Performance communication must be fair, accurate, and complete.\n\n**(c) Standard II(A) \u2014 Material Nonpublic Information.** Information about a pending acquisition is clearly material (would affect stock price) and nonpublic (from a private source). The trader must not act on this information or cause others to act on it.\n\n**(d) Standard I(B) \u2014 Independence and Objectivity.** The analyst is being pressured to compromise her independent judgment for commercial reasons. She must resist this pressure and base her recommendation solely on investment merit.\n\n**(e) Standard VI(B) \u2014 Priority of Transactions.** Client transactions must take priority over personal transactions. Trading a hot IPO into a personal account before filling client orders is a classic violation."
