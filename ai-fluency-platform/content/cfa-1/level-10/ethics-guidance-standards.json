When there is a conflict between different rules, **follow the stricter requirement**.\n\n**Key guidance:**\n- You are not required to be a legal expert, but you must know the laws that apply to your work\n- When in doubt, consult compliance or legal counsel\n- If you become aware of a violation by a colleague, you should attempt to stop it by escalating through your supervisor, compliance, or legal department\n- Dissociating from the activity is required if the firm does not act; in extreme cases, this may mean resignation\n\n### I(B) Independence and Objectivity\nMembers must not allow external influences to compromise their professional judgment.\n\n**Common threats:** gifts from covered companies, client pressure to change ratings, investment banking pressure on research analysts, travel funded by issuers\n\n**Recommended procedures:** Restrict gifts to token items, create firewalls between research and investment banking, publicly disclose all conflicts\n\n### I(C) Misrepresentation\nDo not knowingly make any misrepresentation relating to investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities. This includes **plagiarism** \u2014 using someone else's work without attribution.\n\n### I(D) Misconduct\nDo not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit, or commit any act that reflects adversely on professional reputation, integrity, or competence. Note: personal behavior can violate this standard if it reflects on professional competence."

      "question": "An analyst at a sell-side firm is pressured by his firm's investment banking division to issue a 'Buy' recommendation on a company that is about to become an investment banking client. The analyst's independent analysis suggests the stock is overvalued. If he issues the 'Buy' rating, which Standard does he violate?",
      "answer": "Standard I(B) \u2014 Independence and Objectivity. The analyst is allowing commercial pressure from the investment banking division to override his independent professional judgment. The recommendation should be based solely on his analysis, not on the firm's business relationships. This is one of the most tested scenarios in CFA ethics \u2014 the analyst must maintain objectivity even when it creates internal conflict."

      "content": "## Standard II: Integrity of Capital Markets\n\n### II(A) Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)\nMembers who possess MNPI must not act or cause others to act on it.\n\n**The mosaic theory** is the key exception: analysts may construct an investment conclusion from a combination of public information and **non-material** nonpublic information (such as insights from industry contacts that are not individually material). The resulting conclusion, even if material, can be acted upon because no single piece of material nonpublic information was used.\n\n**Determining materiality:** Would a reasonable investor consider this information important in making an investment decision? If yes, it is material. Examples include: earnings surprises, mergers and acquisitions, changes in dividends, major contract wins/losses, regulatory actions.\n\n**Determining if information is nonpublic:** Has the information been disseminated to the marketplace in a manner that gives investors time to react? Simply overhearing executives talk is not public dissemination.\n\n**Recommended procedures:** Information barriers (\"Chinese walls\") between departments, restricted lists, watch lists, review of employee trading\n\n### II(B) Market Manipulation\nDo not engage in practices that distort market prices or artificially inflate trading volume. This includes:\n- **Transaction-based manipulation:** Wash trading, painting the tape, cornering the market\n- **Information-based manipulation:** Spreading false rumors, issuing misleading research to move prices"

Exercise the care that a **prudent person** would exercise in managing their own affairs.\n\n**Key points:** Determine who the client is (the beneficiary or the entity?), soft dollar arrangements must benefit the client, voting proxies responsibly\n\n### III(B) Fair Dealing\nDeal fairly and objectively with **all** clients when disseminating recommendations or taking investment action. \"Fairly\" does not mean \"equally\" \u2014 different service levels are acceptable if disclosed, but all clients should receive recommendations in a way that does not systematically advantage some over others.\n\n**Recommended procedures:** Simultaneous dissemination of recommendations, pro-rata allocation of IPOs and oversubscribed offerings, written trade allocation policies\n\n### III(C) Suitability\nBefore making recommendations, understand the client's:\n- Investment experience and knowledge\n- Risk and return objectives\n- Financial constraints (time horizon, liquidity needs, tax considerations, legal restrictions, unique circumstances)\n\nFor managed accounts, ensure each investment is suitable in the **portfolio context** \u2014 a risky investment may be suitable as part of a diversified portfolio even if it would be unsuitable on its own.\n\n### III(D) Performance Presentation\nPerformance data must be fair, accurate, and complete. Do not cherry-pick time periods, misstate results, or omit material facts. GIPS compliance is recommended.\n\n### III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality\nKeep client information confidential unless: (1) the information concerns illegal activities, (2) disclosure is required by law, or (3) the client permits disclosure."

However, you may take **general knowledge and skills** \u2014 you just cannot take proprietary models, client lists, or confidential strategies.\n\n**IV(B) Additional Compensation:** Do not accept gifts, benefits, or compensation from third parties that create a conflict with your employer's interest without **written consent** from all parties involved.\n\n**IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors:** Supervisors must make reasonable efforts to detect and prevent violations. Having a compliance system is necessary, but not sufficient \u2014 supervisors must also **enforce** it and follow up on red flags.\n\n### Standard V: Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions\n\n**V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis:** Every recommendation must be supported by thorough research. When relying on third-party research, exercise judgment about whether the source is credible and the analysis is sound.\n\n**V(B) Communication:** Distinguish between fact and opinion. Disclose the basic format of your investment process, including significant limitations and risks.\n\n**V(C) Record Retention:** Maintain records that support your analysis and recommendations. If no specific retention period is mandated, CFA Institute recommends **seven years**.\n\n### Standard VI: Conflicts of Interest\n\n**VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts:** Disclose all conflicts \u2014 compensation structures, ownership in recommended securities, board memberships \u2014 in plain language that clients can understand.\n\n**VI(B) Priority of Transactions:** Client transactions first, employer transactions second, personal transactions last. Establish pre-clearance procedures for personal trading.\n\n**VI(C) Referral Fees:** Disclose to clients any compensation you receive for referring them to other services, so they can evaluate the objectivity of your recommendation.\n\n### Standard VII: Responsibilities as CFA Member\n\n**VII(A) Conduct:** Do not cheat on the CFA exam or compromise its integrity.\n\n**VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute:** \"CFA\" is an adjective (\"CFA charterholder\"), not a noun (\"I am a CFA\"). Do not imply guaranteed performance. May not claim partial designation (e.g., \"CFA Level II passed\" does not make you a \"CFA Level II\")."

      "title": "Mosaic Theory Application: You are an analyst covering a pharmaceutical company. From public sources, you learn that: (1) the company's lead drug candidate completed Phase III trials (press release), (2) the FDA approval rate for drugs with similar trial data is 85% (public statistics), (3) the company recently hired three senior regulatory affairs specialists (public LinkedIn profiles). From a non-material nonpublic conversation with an industry consultant, you learn that: (4) the regulatory affairs team seems unusually confident and well-prepared. Based on this mosaic, you conclude the drug will likely be approved and recommend buying the stock. Is this a violation of Standard II(A)?",
      "solution": "**No, this is a legitimate application of the mosaic theory.** Your conclusion is based on:\n\n- **Public information:** Phase III trial completion (press release), FDA approval rates for similar drugs (public data), and hiring patterns (public LinkedIn profiles)\n- **Non-material nonpublic information:** The consultant's observation about the regulatory team's confidence. This is a qualitative impression, not specific insider knowledge about FDA decisions.\n\nNo single piece of your information is both material AND nonpublic. You have combined public data with non-material nonpublic insights to form a mosaic that produces a material conclusion. This is exactly how the mosaic theory is intended to work \u2014 it allows analysts to add value through research without violating insider trading rules.\n\n**However, if the consultant had said:** \"I saw the FDA approval letter on someone's desk\" \u2014 that would be material nonpublic information, and the mosaic theory would NOT protect you."

When her firm issues a new 'Buy' recommendation, Lisa allocates the shares to institutional clients first because they generate higher fees, then offers remaining shares to individual clients. Has Lisa violated any Standard?",
          "options": [
            "A) No, because firms may offer different service levels to different client tiers.",
            "B) Yes, she has violated Standard III(B) \u2014 Fair Dealing by systematically disadvantaging individual clients.",
            "C) Yes, she has violated Standard III(A) \u2014 Loyalty, Prudence, and Care by failing to exercise fiduciary duty."

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard III(B) \u2014 Fair Dealing requires that all clients be treated fairly when investment actions are taken. While different service levels are permissible (e.g., faster execution for premium clients), systematically allocating desirable shares to one group before another based on fee revenue violates fair dealing. Proper procedure would be pro-rata allocation across all participating accounts. Option A is incorrect because fair dealing allows different service levels in dissemination of research, but not systematic preference in trade execution. Option C touches on a related concept but the most directly violated standard is Fair Dealing, not the general duty of loyalty.",

Marcus returns to his office and recommends buying the stock. Has Marcus violated Standard II(A)?",
          "options": [

The form in which the information is retained (physical, electronic, or memorized) does not change its nature as employer property. Memorizing client details to solicit them at a new firm is a violation. Option A is incorrect because the distinction between general knowledge/skills (which you may take) and proprietary information (which you may not) does not hinge on the storage medium.

The client's Investment Policy Statement specifies a moderate risk tolerance and a 10-year time horizon. Tom identifies a speculative biotech stock that he believes could triple in value. The position would represent 2% of the portfolio. Which of the following is most accurate regarding suitability?",

            "A) The investment is unsuitable because speculative stocks are never appropriate for moderate-risk clients.",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Under Standard III(C) \u2014 Suitability, individual investments must be judged in the context of the total portfolio, not in isolation. A 2% allocation to a speculative stock may be appropriate within a diversified moderate-risk portfolio if the overall portfolio still meets the client's risk and return objectives. Option A is incorrect because suitability is assessed at the portfolio level, not the individual security level \u2014 a speculative position can be suitable if it does not change the portfolio's overall risk profile beyond the client's tolerance.

A proper statement would be: 'Based on our analysis, we estimate the stock's intrinsic value at $45.'
