          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard III(C) Suitability requires the advisor to consider the client's entire financial situation, not just their stated preferences:\n\n- **Age (75):** Short time horizon, limited ability to recover from losses\n- **Modest savings:** High dependence on portfolio for retirement income\n- **Speculative stocks (80%):** Inappropriate concentration and risk level\n\nEven though the client expressed enthusiasm, the advisor has a professional duty to recommend a suitable strategy. Client consent does not absolve the advisor of suitability obligations. The advisor should:\n1. Educate the client about the risks\n2. Recommend a more appropriate allocation\n3. Document the discussion and rationale\n4. If the client insists, document the recommendation against professional advice",
