      "content": "## The Case Study Approach\n\nThe CFA exam tests ethics primarily through **scenario-based questions**. Success requires a systematic approach, not just knowledge of the Standards.\n\n### Step-by-Step Case Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Read the entire scenario before answering.** Ethical questions often contain details at the end that change the analysis. Avoid jumping to conclusions from the first sentence.\n\n**Step 2: Identify ALL relevant Standards.** Most exam scenarios involve multiple Standards. A common trap is identifying the most obvious violation while missing a subtler one.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the stakeholders.** Who is affected? Clients, the firm, the market, colleagues, the profession? Each stakeholder triggers different duties.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the specific guidance.** What do the Standards say about this exact situation? Focus on the recommended procedures and specific prohibitions.\n\n**Step 5: Eliminate distractors.** On the CFA exam, wrong answers often cite a real Standard that is not relevant to the specific facts, or state a correct principle but apply it incorrectly.\n\n### Common Exam Traps\n\n- Confusing \"fair dealing\" with \"equal dealing\" (different service levels are acceptable)\n- Assuming all gifts violate independence (token/modest gifts generally do not)\n- Thinking local law always takes precedence (CFA standard applies when stricter)\n- Forgetting that suitability is assessed at the **portfolio level**, not the individual security level\n- Confusing the mosaic theory with acting on MNPI"

      "question": "An analyst receives a text from a friend who works at a biotech company: 'Big day tomorrow, wish us luck!' The analyst knows the company has a drug under FDA review. Can the analyst trade on this information?",
      "answer": "Probably yes. The text is vague \u2014 'big day' and 'wish us luck' do not convey specific material information. The analyst already knows (from public sources) that the FDA is reviewing the drug, so the fact that something is happening is not nonpublic. However, if the analyst interprets this as confirmation of a specific outcome (e.g., 'they know the approval is coming'), the line gets blurrier. The key test: does the message convey specific, material information that is not available to the public? A vague expression of excitement likely does not cross that threshold, but the analyst should err on the side of caution and consult compliance."

      "content": "## Common Ethical Scenarios\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\nConflicts are the most frequently tested area. Key patterns:\n- Analyst covers a company where she owns stock (must disclose per VI(A))\n- Portfolio manager's compensation is tied to assets under management, creating incentive to gather assets rather than optimize returns (must disclose)\n- Financial advisor receives referral fees for recommending certain products (must disclose per VI(C))\n\n**The rule:** Conflicts do not need to be eliminated \u2014 they need to be **disclosed** in a manner that allows clients to evaluate the potential impact.\n\n### Material Nonpublic Information\n- The \"materiality\" test: Would a reasonable investor consider this information important?\n- The \"nonpublic\" test: Has the information been broadly disseminated to the marketplace?\n- Mosaic theory is a legitimate defense only when no single piece of information is both material AND nonpublic\n- If you receive MNPI, you should: (1) not trade, (2) not communicate the info to others, (3) contact compliance\n\n### Fair Dealing and Suitability\n- All clients must receive investment recommendations at approximately the same time\n- IPO allocations must follow a documented, fair process (typically pro-rata)\n- Suitability requires understanding the client's full financial picture before recommending investments\n- An investment unsuitable on its own may be suitable within a diversified portfolio context"

Attempt to resolve internally first:**\n- Speak with the person involved (if appropriate)\n- Escalate to your supervisor\n- Report to the compliance department\n- Escalate to senior management or the board if compliance is unresponsive\n\n**2. External reporting:**\n- If the firm fails to act, you may need to report to regulatory authorities\n- In some jurisdictions, you may be legally required to report certain violations\n- Standard I(A) may require dissociation \u2014 you cannot continue participating in the violating activity\n- **Dissociation may include resignation** if the firm refuses to address the violation\n\n**3. Reporting to CFA Institute:**\n- Members have an obligation to cooperate with CFA Institute's Professional Conduct Program\n- CFA Institute investigates complaints through its Disciplinary Review Committee\n- Sanctions range from private censure to permanent revocation of the CFA charter\n\n### The Reporting Obligation\n\nA common misconception: Standard I(A) does not explicitly require you to report violations by others to regulatory authorities or CFA Institute. It does require you to:\n- Not participate in the violation\n- Attempt to stop the violation through appropriate internal channels\n- Dissociate from the activity if it continues\n\nHowever, applicable law may independently require reporting, and members must comply with the stricter standard."

Consider the following facts:\n\n(a) Alex manages both the firm's Growth Fund (a pooled fund) and separate accounts for high-net-worth individuals.\n\n(b) Alex's brother-in-law, who is CFO of TechCorp, tells Alex at a family dinner that TechCorp will announce a major acquisition next week. Alex does not trade on this information in client accounts, but he does tell his colleague, Beth, about the acquisition without mentioning the source.\n\n(c) Beth, not knowing the information is MNPI, buys TechCorp shares for her personal account.\n\n(d) Alex recently published a research report on TechCorp. The report uses a valuation model from a well-known research firm, but Alex presents the analysis as his own.\n\n(e) When Pinnacle allocates a hot IPO, Alex gives his high-net-worth separate account clients first priority, then the Growth Fund receives any remaining allocation.",
      "solution": "**(b) Alex violates Standard II(A) \u2014 Material Nonpublic Information.** Even though Alex did not trade himself, he \"caused others to act\" on MNPI by telling Beth about the acquisition. The information is clearly material (an acquisition would affect TechCorp's stock price) and nonpublic (learned at a private family dinner).\n\n**(c) Beth likely does not violate Standard II(A)** because she did not know the information was MNPI. However, she may have failed to exercise adequate diligence in questioning the source of the tip. If she had reason to suspect the information was MNPI (e.g., Alex mentioned his brother-in-law works at TechCorp), she could be held to a higher standard.\n\n**(d) Alex violates Standard I(C) \u2014 Misrepresentation (plagiarism).** Presenting another firm's valuation model as his own, without attribution, constitutes misrepresentation regardless of whether the underlying analysis is correct.\n\n**(e) Alex violates Standard III(B) \u2014 Fair Dealing.** By systematically giving high-net-worth clients priority over the pooled fund, Alex is not dealing fairly with all clients. IPO allocations should be distributed on a pro-rata or other documented fair basis across all participating accounts.\n\n**Correct course of action for Alex regarding the MNPI:** He should have (1) not shared the information with anyone, (2) reported the situation to Pinnacle's compliance department, and (3) placed TechCorp on the firm's restricted list until the information became public."

A long-time client, Mr. Tanaka, asks Karen to invest his entire retirement portfolio in a single cryptocurrency because his neighbor made a fortune doing so.

Investing an entire retirement portfolio in a single speculative asset directly contradicts a conservative risk tolerance and income need. Karen should refuse, explain why, and document the discussion. If Mr. Tanaka insists after being fully informed, Karen should consider whether to continue the relationship. Option A is incorrect because client requests do not override suitability obligations for discretionary accounts. Even for non-discretionary accounts, Karen has a duty to advise against unsuitable investments. Option C may seem like a reasonable compromise but does not address the fundamental suitability concern \u2014 the client requested 100% allocation, and a 5% allocation does not fulfill the request while pretending to.",

Standard II(A) applies regardless of when his thesis was developed. Option A is incorrect because the timing of the thesis development does not matter \u2014 once you have MNPI, you cannot act on it. Option C incorrectly applies the mosaic theory. The mosaic theory allows combining public information with non-material nonpublic information.
