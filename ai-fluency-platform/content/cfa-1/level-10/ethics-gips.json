Firm B included all accounts managed in that strategy. How would you, as a prospective client, know which firm's number to trust? What kind of standard would prevent this problem?"

      "content": "## Why GIPS Exists\n\nWithout a universal performance reporting standard, firms could:\n- **Cherry-pick accounts** \u2014 report only their best-performing accounts\n- **Survivorship bias** \u2014 exclude accounts that were terminated or performed poorly\n- **Select favorable time periods** \u2014 choose start and end dates that maximize reported returns\n- **Use inconsistent methodologies** \u2014 make comparisons across firms meaningless\n\nThe **Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)** solve these problems by providing a globally recognized, standardized framework for calculating and presenting investment performance.\n\n### Key Features of GIPS\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|---|---|\n| **Voluntary** | GIPS compliance is voluntary but highly valued by institutional investors |\n| **Firm-wide** | Must be applied on a **firm-wide basis** \u2014 you cannot claim partial GIPS compliance |\n| **Composites** | Performance is reported using composites, not individual accounts |\n| **Fair representation** | The standards are designed to ensure fair representation and full disclosure |\n| **Global standard** | GIPS is administered by CFA Institute and adopted in over 40 countries |\n\n**Critical point for the exam:** A firm either complies with GIPS in its entirety or it does not. There is no such thing as \"partial compliance\" or \"compliance except for...\" Firms may not claim compliance unless they meet **all** applicable requirements."

      "question": "A firm states in its marketing materials: 'Our domestic equity strategy is GIPS compliant.' Is this a proper claim of GIPS compliance?",
      "answer": "No. GIPS compliance must be applied on a firm-wide basis, not at the strategy or composite level. The proper claim is that the firm \u2014 as an entity \u2014 claims compliance with the GIPS standards. Saying a single strategy is compliant implies that other parts of the firm may not be, which violates the firm-wide requirement. The correct statement would be: 'XYZ Investment Management claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS).'"

      "content": "## Composites\n\nA **composite** is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Composites are the core unit of GIPS reporting.\n\n### Composite Construction Rules\n\n- **All actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios** must be included in at least one composite\n- Portfolios must be assigned to composites based on their investment mandate **before** performance is known (no retroactive cherry-picking)\n- Non-discretionary portfolios (where the client restricts the manager's ability to implement the strategy) are excluded\n- Terminated portfolios must remain in the composite's historical record through their last full measurement period\n- New portfolios must be added to composites in a timely and consistent manner (typically by the start of the next full measurement period)\n\n### Why Composites Matter\n\nComposites prevent the most common form of performance manipulation: **selection bias**. By requiring all portfolios managed to a given strategy to be grouped together, GIPS ensures that the reported return reflects the experience of all clients in that strategy, not just the lucky ones.\n\n## Input Data and Calculation\n\n- Returns must be calculated using **time-weighted rates of return** (TWRR), which eliminate the distorting effect of client cash flows\n- For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2001, portfolios must be valued at least **monthly**\n- For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010, portfolios must be valued on the date of all **large cash flows**\n- External cash flows must be treated consistently"

      "title": "Composite Construction Exercise: You manage three equity portfolios with the following characteristics. Determine which should be included in your 'US Large Cap Growth' composite, and explain why.\n\nPortfolio A: $50M discretionary US large cap growth mandate, fully invested per strategy guidelines.\n\nPortfolio B: $30M US large cap growth mandate, but the client restricts you from holding tobacco, alcohol, or gambling stocks (which are part of your standard strategy).\n\nPortfolio C: $20M US large cap growth mandate, client joined last month and the portfolio is still in the transition phase (60% cash).\n\nPortfolio D: $15M US large cap growth mandate that was terminated 6 months ago (client moved to another firm).",
      "solution": "**Portfolio A: INCLUDE.** This is a discretionary, fee-paying portfolio managed according to the US Large Cap Growth strategy. It meets all requirements for composite inclusion.\n\n**Portfolio B: EXCLUDE (most likely).** The client has imposed significant restrictions (excluding tobacco, alcohol, and gambling) that prevent the manager from fully implementing the strategy. If these restrictions materially prevent the manager from executing the investment mandate, the portfolio is considered non-discretionary and should be excluded. However, if the restrictions are immaterial to strategy implementation, it could be included.\n\n**Portfolio C: DEPENDS ON POLICY.** The portfolio is still being transitioned and does not yet reflect the strategy. Most firms establish a policy (e.g., 'new portfolios are added to the composite at the start of the first full month after being substantially invested'). Until that threshold is met, it is typically excluded. The key is that the policy must be consistently applied.\n\n**Portfolio D: KEEP IN HISTORICAL RECORD.** Terminated portfolios must remain in the composite's historical performance through their last full measurement period. You cannot remove them retroactively. This prevents survivorship bias \u2014 if a poor-performing account leaves, removing its history would inflate the composite's track record."

          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "GIPS requires a minimum of 5 years of compliant performance, OR since firm inception if the firm has been in existence for less than 5 years. Since Greenfield has only been in operation for 3 years, it must present all 3 years. It must then add one year annually until it reaches a 10-year track record. Option B is incorrect because the 5-year minimum only applies when the firm has been in existence for 5 or more years. Option C represents the eventual target, not the initial requirement.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "GIPS verification is performed at the firm-wide level and tests whether: (1) the firm has complied with all composite construction requirements on a firm-wide basis, and (2) the firm's processes and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with GIPS. Verification does not guarantee the accuracy of any specific composite report.

A firm may provide supplemental information (including individual portfolio data) as long as: (1) the GIPS-compliant composite presentation is the primary document, and (2) the supplemental data is clearly labeled as such and does not contradict or overshadow the compliant presentation. Option A is incorrect because providing only an individual portfolio return would not constitute a GIPS-compliant presentation.
