Each question is designed to mirror the complexity and style of the CFA Level I exam.\n\nEthics represents **15\u201320%** of the CFA Level I exam. Questions focus on scenario analysis and application \u2014 not memorization of the Standards word-for-word."

          "question": "Yuki Tanaka, CFA, is an equity research analyst at a major investment bank. The firm's investment banking division is pitching to underwrite an IPO for NovaTech, a company Yuki covers. Yuki's independent analysis indicates NovaTech is overvalued at the proposed IPO price. Her department head asks her to 'soften the language' in her report to avoid jeopardizing the banking relationship, suggesting she change her rating from 'Sell' to 'Hold.' Yuki changes the rating to 'Hold' without changing her underlying analysis. Which Standard has Yuki most likely violated?",
          "options": [
            "A) Standard I(B) \u2014 Independence and Objectivity",
            "B) Standard V(B) \u2014 Communication with Clients",

          ],
          "correctAnswer": "A",
          "explanation": "Yuki violated Standard I(B) by allowing the investment banking relationship to influence her research rating. Her independent analysis supports a 'Sell,' but she changed it to 'Hold' due to commercial pressure \u2014 a direct compromise of her professional independence. Option B (Communication) is related because the 'Hold' rating is inconsistent with her analysis, but the root cause is the failure to maintain independence, not a communication issue per se. Option C (Misrepresentation) is tempting because the 'Hold' rating misrepresents her view, but the specific violation stems from surrendering independent judgment to external pressure, which is the core of I(B).",

A high-net-worth client invested $10M two years ago but has since been unhappy with performance and withdrew her assets last quarter. The portfolio had significantly underperformed the composite average during the period it was included. Under GIPS, which of the following is correct regarding the treatment of this portfolio?",
          "options": [
            "A) The portfolio should be removed from the composite's historical record since the client has withdrawn.",

This prevents survivorship bias \u2014 the systematic removal of underperforming accounts to inflate historical returns. Option A is incorrect because removing terminated portfolios would allow firms to improve their historical track records whenever poor-performing clients leave. Option C is incorrect because GIPS does not permit exclusion based on performance impact; composite construction must follow objective, strategy-based criteria, not results-based criteria.",

Her former employer claims she has stolen intellectual property. Under the Standards, which of the following is most accurate?",

            "A) Ana has violated Standard IV(A) because she is using knowledge developed during her prior employment.",

An analyst who develops expertise in a particular modeling approach may use that general knowledge at a new employer, provided she does not take the actual proprietary code, data, or specific implementation. Since Ana recreated the model from scratch using new data, she is applying general skills rather than taking proprietary property. Option A is incorrect because it conflates general knowledge with proprietary materials \u2014 the Standards explicitly permit taking general skills to a new employer. Option C is incorrect because Ana is not misrepresenting the source; she built the model herself at her new firm using a similar approach.",

'CFA Level II Candidate' suggests he holds some form of CFA credential for having passed Level I. The acceptable format is: 'Dmitri Volkov, CFA Level II candidate' or 'Candidate in the CFA Program.' The critical distinction is that 'CFA' must not appear to be a credential or title \u2014 it should be clear that the person is a candidate in the program, not a holder of a partial designation. Option A is incorrect because while the facts may be accurate, the formatting violates Standard VII(B) by placing 'CFA' as a post-nominal credential.

The friend says: 'I'm hearing from my contacts in the semiconductor industry that GlobalChip's new fabrication process is a game-changer. Multiple engineers I've spoken to are really impressed, but nothing has been formally announced yet.' Wei's own research has been bullish on GlobalChip based on published patent filings and industry trends. Can Wei legitimately act on this information?",
          "options": [
            "A) No, because the information about the fabrication process is material nonpublic information.",

          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "This is a valid application of the mosaic theory. The individual pieces of information from the friend's contacts \u2014 general impressions from engineers about the quality of a new process \u2014 are likely non-material on their own (they are qualitative opinions, not specific financial data like revenue projections or formal announcements). When combined with Wei's public research (patent filings, industry trends), the resulting conclusion may be material, but no single piece is both material AND nonpublic. Option A would be correct if the friend had shared specific, material information (e.g., exact performance specifications or a production timeline that has not been announced). Option C is incorrect because the secondhand nature of information does not determine its public/nonpublic status \u2014 the test is whether it has been broadly disseminated to the market.",

          "question": "Sarah Mitchell, CFA, is a compliance officer at a mid-size asset management firm. She discovers that a junior portfolio manager has been accepting expensive tickets to sporting events from a broker who executes a significant portion of the firm's trades. The portfolio manager argues the tickets do not affect his choice of brokers because he always selects best execution. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion?",
          "options": [
            "A) No violation, because the portfolio manager can demonstrate that his broker selection is based on execution quality.",
            "B) A violation of Standard I(B), because the gifts create the appearance of compromised independence regardless of whether actual bias exists.",
            "C) No violation, because the gifts are from a broker, not from a company whose securities the portfolio manager covers."
          ],
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Standard I(B) \u2014 Independence and Objectivity prohibits accepting gifts that could reasonably be expected to compromise independence. The test is not whether the portfolio manager is actually biased, but whether the gifts could reasonably create the appearance of bias or an obligation. Expensive sporting tickets from a broker whose business depends on being selected for trade execution create exactly this appearance. Option A is incorrect because Standard I(B) focuses on the threat to independence, not just the outcome. Even if execution quality is currently optimal, the gift creates an obligation that could influence future decisions. Option C is incorrect because the standard applies to any gift that could compromise objectivity, regardless of whether the gift-giver is an issuer, broker, or other business partner.",

          "explanation": "GIPS allows firms to link non-compliant performance to their GIPS-compliant track record, provided that the non-compliant periods are clearly labeled and disclosed. This gives firms the ability to show a longer performance history while maintaining transparency about which periods meet GIPS requirements. Firms must not present non-compliant performance for periods after January 1, 2000 as if it were compliant. Option A is overly restrictive \u2014 GIPS does not require firms to discard historical data, only to clearly disclose which periods are compliant.

If the client insists after full disclosure, James should evaluate whether to continue the advisory relationship \u2014 he cannot implement a strategy he believes is clearly unsuitable. Option A is incorrect for a discretionary account \u2014 the manager has responsibility for investment decisions and cannot simply defer to client wishes when the investment is clearly unsuitable. Option C is a compromise that James might discuss with the client as part of the conversation, but unilaterally reducing the allocation to 10% does not address the client's stated wish and may still be unsuitable depending on the client's overall situation.",
