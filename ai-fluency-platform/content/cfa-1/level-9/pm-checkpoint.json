The vacation account loss reduces her total net worth, but she doesn't perceive it that way. Self-control bias: she is unable or unwilling to reduce consumption (vacations) despite a material wealth reduction. Option A involves reluctance to realize losses and inertia, which are not the primary issues. Option C involves excessive conviction and pattern-matching, which don't explain the bucket-based thinking.",

CVaR of $8 million means that when losses exceed the $5 million VaR threshold, the average loss is $8 million. Together they describe both the frequency and severity of tail losses.
