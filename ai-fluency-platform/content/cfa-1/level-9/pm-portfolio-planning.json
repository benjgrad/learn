      "content": "## The Investment Policy Statement (IPS)\n\nThe **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)** is the governing document for portfolio management. It translates an investor's needs into a clear, actionable plan. The IPS has two major components: **objectives** and **constraints**.\n\n### Return Objectives\n\nThe return objective specifies the required or desired rate of return. It should be:\n- **Realistic** given capital market expectations\n- **Consistent** with the investor's risk tolerance\n- Stated in **nominal or real terms** (after or before inflation)\n- Specified as **total return** (income + capital appreciation) or income-only\n\n### Risk Tolerance\n\nRisk tolerance has two dimensions:\n\n| Dimension | Description | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Ability** to take risk | Determined by financial circumstances (time horizon, wealth, income stability) | A young professional with stable income has high ability |\n| **Willingness** to take risk | Determined by psychology and preferences | The same individual may be psychologically conservative |\n\nWhen ability and willingness conflict, the **more conservative** assessment typically governs. An investor with high ability but low willingness should not be pushed into aggressive strategies."

      "question": "A 60-year-old retiree with a $5 million portfolio and no pension income needs $150,000/year for living expenses. What is her minimum required return (before inflation), and how would you describe her risk tolerance?",
      "answer": "Minimum required return = $150,000 / $5,000,000 = 3.0% per year (nominal, before inflation adjustment). If she needs to maintain purchasing power, the real return target would be 3% plus the expected inflation rate. Her ability to take risk is moderate \u2014 she has a large portfolio relative to spending needs but no other income source, and her time horizon may be 25-30 years. She needs her portfolio to last. Risk tolerance depends on willingness as well, but the ability side suggests a moderate, balanced approach."

      "content": "## Asset Allocation\n\nAsset allocation is the most important determinant of portfolio risk and return over time. Studies attribute roughly **90% of return variation** across diversified portfolios to asset allocation decisions.\n\n### Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA)\n\nThe **long-term, policy-level** mix of asset classes designed to meet the IPS objectives. SAA reflects the investor's long-term risk-return tradeoff and is typically revisited annually or when circumstances change materially.\n\nExample: 60% equities / 30% fixed income / 10% alternatives\n\n### Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)\n\n**Short-term deviations** from the SAA to exploit perceived market opportunities. TAA involves overweighting asset classes expected to outperform and underweighting those expected to underperform.\n\nExample: Temporarily shifting to 65% equities because the manager believes stocks are undervalued.\n\n### Rebalancing\n\nOver time, asset weights drift due to differential returns. **Rebalancing** restores the portfolio to its target allocation. Common approaches:\n\n- **Calendar rebalancing:** Rebalance at fixed intervals (monthly, quarterly)\n- **Percentage-of-portfolio rebalancing:** Rebalance when an asset class deviates beyond a threshold (e.g., \u00b15%)\n\nRebalancing involves a tradeoff: it maintains the desired risk profile but incurs transaction costs and potential tax consequences."

      "title": "Draft the key elements of an IPS for the following client: Maria, age 45, earns $200,000/year as a physician, has $1.2 million saved, wants to retire at 65, has no pension, needs $120,000/year in retirement (today's dollars), is moderately risk-averse, and wants to avoid tobacco stocks.",
      "solution": "**Return objective:** Maria needs her $1.2M portfolio to grow over 20 years to fund ~$120,000/year (inflation-adjusted) in retirement lasting ~25 years. Assuming 2.5% inflation, her real spending need is $120,000, requiring a portfolio of approximately $2.5-3.0M at retirement. This implies a required real return of roughly 4-5% per year during the accumulation phase.\n\n**Risk tolerance:** Ability is moderate to high (20-year horizon, high stable income, adequate savings). Willingness is moderate (described as moderately risk-averse). Overall: moderate risk tolerance.\n\n**Time horizon:** Two stages \u2014 20 years of accumulation, then ~25 years of distribution. Long overall horizon.\n\n**Liquidity:** Low near-term needs (high income covers expenses). May need an emergency reserve of 3-6 months' expenses.\n\n**Tax:** High income bracket \u2014 should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments.\n\n**Legal/Regulatory:** Standard individual investor regulations; prudent investor rule.\n\n**Unique circumstances:** ESG screen excluding tobacco stocks. No other special constraints mentioned.\n\n**Suggested SAA:** 70% equities / 25% fixed income / 5% alternatives (consistent with long horizon and moderate risk tolerance)."

The manager should rebalance by selling equities and buying bonds to return to the 60/40 SAA target. Option A is incorrect because the 10-point drift exceeds the \u00b15% threshold.
