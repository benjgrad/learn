      "content": "## The Portfolio Approach\n\nThe **portfolio perspective** evaluates individual investments not in isolation, but by their contribution to the overall portfolio's risk and return. A stock that is very volatile on its own might actually reduce portfolio risk if it has low correlation with existing holdings.\n\nThis is the core insight of modern portfolio theory: **it is the interaction among assets that matters**, not just each asset's standalone characteristics.\n\n### Why a Portfolio Approach?\n\n- Diversification reduces risk without necessarily reducing expected return\n- An asset's risk contribution depends on its correlation with the rest of the portfolio\n- An individually \"risky\" asset may be appropriate if it improves the portfolio's risk-return profile\n- Evaluating securities in isolation leads to suboptimal portfolio construction\n\n### The Three Steps of Portfolio Management\n\n| Step | Activity | Key Output |\n|---|---|---|\n| **1. Planning** | Understand the investor's needs, create an IPS | Investment Policy Statement (IPS) |\n| **2. Execution** | Construct the portfolio via asset allocation and security selection | Invested portfolio |\n| **3. Feedback** | Monitor performance, rebalance, adapt to changing circumstances | Revised portfolio |"

      "question": "A university endowment and a bank's bond portfolio both hold fixed-income securities. Are their investment objectives likely to be the same? Why or why not?",
      "answer": "No. The endowment's objective is typically to maintain purchasing power over a very long time horizon while providing a stable spending stream (e.g., 4-5% annual payout). It can tolerate moderate volatility. The bank holds bonds primarily for liquidity management and regulatory compliance, with a much shorter effective time horizon and near-zero tolerance for credit losses. Same asset class, fundamentally different objectives, constraints, and risk tolerances."

Their needs vary widely by age, wealth, income stability, and risk tolerance. Life-cycle investing suggests younger investors can take more risk (longer time horizon), while older investors should shift toward less volatile assets.\n\n### Institutional Investors\n\n| Investor Type | Time Horizon | Risk Tolerance | Key Characteristic |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Defined benefit pension** | Long | Moderate to high | Must meet future liability payments to retirees |\n| **Endowment/Foundation** | Very long (perpetual) | High | Must preserve real value while funding spending |\n| **Insurance company** | Depends on product | Low to moderate | Must match asset durations to policy liabilities |\n| **Sovereign wealth fund (SWF)** | Very long | High | Invests national surplus for future generations |\n| **Bank** | Short | Low | Manages liquidity, meets regulatory capital requirements |"

      "content": "## Pooled Investment Vehicles\n\nMost investors access markets through pooled vehicles rather than buying individual securities:\n\n**Mutual funds (open-end):** Issue new shares on demand at net asset value (NAV). Investors can redeem at NAV daily. Actively managed funds attempt to outperform a benchmark; passively managed (index) funds track a benchmark at low cost.\n\n**Exchange-traded funds (ETFs):** Trade on exchanges like stocks throughout the day at market prices (which may differ slightly from NAV). Most are passively managed. Key advantages: intraday liquidity, tax efficiency, low expense ratios.\n\n**Hedge funds:** Private investment pools using strategies like leverage, short selling, and derivatives. Typically limited to qualified/accredited investors. Common fee structure: \"2 and 20\" (2% management fee + 20% performance fee). Often have lock-up periods restricting withdrawals.\n\n| Vehicle | Pricing | Liquidity | Typical Fees | Investor Access |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Mutual fund | NAV (end of day) | Daily redemption | 0.5\u20131.5% | Public |\n| ETF | Market price (intraday) | Intraday trading | 0.03\u20130.50% | Public |\n| Hedge fund | NAV (periodic) | Lock-up periods | 2% + 20% | Qualified only |"

      "solution": "**(a) University endowment:** Very long (perpetual) time horizon; high risk tolerance. The endowment aims to exist indefinitely and can weather short-term volatility to earn higher long-term returns.\n\n**(b) Life insurance company:** Long time horizon but low to moderate risk tolerance. It must match asset cash flows to policy liabilities and faces regulatory constraints. Predictability of cash flows is critical.\n\n**(c) 30-year-old individual:** Long time horizon (35 years); moderate to high risk tolerance. Human capital (future earnings) provides a buffer, allowing more equity exposure early.\n\n**(d) Sovereign wealth fund:** Very long time horizon; high risk tolerance. Investing national surplus for future generations, with no near-term liabilities. Can allocate heavily to equities, real assets, and alternatives."
