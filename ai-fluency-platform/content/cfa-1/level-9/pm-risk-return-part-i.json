For risk-averse investors, these curves slope upward (more risk requires more return). Steeper curves indicate greater risk aversion.\n\n| Investor Type | $A$ Value | Behavior |\n|---|---|---|\n| Risk-averse | $A > 0$ | Requires compensation for risk |\n| Risk-neutral | $A = 0$ | Indifferent to risk level |\n| Risk-seeking | $A < 0$ | Prefers more risk (unusual) |"
