It answers: \"How much of our total risk capacity should each area consume?\"\n\n### Types of Financial Risk\n\n| Risk Type | Description | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Market risk** | Loss from changes in market prices | Equity decline, interest rate rise |\n| **Credit risk** | Loss from counterparty default | Bond issuer fails to pay |\n| **Liquidity risk** | Inability to trade without significant price impact | Illiquid bond position |\n| **Operational risk** | Loss from failed processes, systems, or people | Trading system failure, fraud |"

      "question": "A firm sets a total VaR budget of $50 million. It allocates $30 million to the equity desk and $25 million to the fixed-income desk. Does this violate the budget? Why or why not?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Due to diversification, the combined VaR of the two desks will likely be less than the sum ($55 million) if the equity and fixed-income positions are not perfectly correlated. VaR is not additive across portfolios unless the correlation between them is +1. The actual combined VaR depends on the correlation between the desks' P&L \u2014 if the correlation is sufficiently low, the combined VaR could be at or below $50 million. However, the firm must verify this through its risk models rather than simply assuming diversification."

More precisely:\n\n> A daily 5% VaR of $10 million means: \"There is a 5% probability that the portfolio will lose **at least** $10 million over the next day.\"\n\nEquivalently: on 95% of days, the loss will be less than $10 million.\n\n### Three Methods of Estimating VaR\n\n| Method | Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Parametric (variance-covariance)** | Assumes returns are normally distributed; uses $\\text{VaR} = \\mu - z\\sigma$ | Simple, fast | Underestimates tail risk; assumes normality |\n| **Historical simulation** | Uses actual historical returns; finds the relevant percentile | No distribution assumption | Assumes past = future; limited by sample size |\n| **Monte Carlo** | Simulates thousands of scenarios from assumed distributions | Flexible; can model complex portfolios | Computationally expensive; depends on assumptions |\n\n### Parametric VaR Example\n\nFor a $100 million portfolio with daily $\\mu = 0.04\\%$ and daily $\\sigma = 1.2\\%$:\n\n$$\\text{5\\% VaR} = -(\\mu - 1.645\\sigma) \\times \\text{Portfolio Value}$$\n$$= -(0.04\\% - 1.645 \\times 1.2\\%) \\times \\$100M$$\n$$= -(0.04\\% - 1.974\\%) \\times \\$100M$$\n$$= 1.934\\% \\times \\$100M = \\$1.934M$$\n\nThe portfolio's daily 5% VaR is approximately **$1.93 million**."

      "solution": "**Parametric 1% VaR:**\n\n$\\text{VaR} = -(\\mu - z\\sigma) \\times \\text{Portfolio Value}$\n\n$= -(0.05\\% - 2.326 \\times 1.5\\%) \\times \\$50M$\n\n$= -(0.05\\% - 3.489\\%) \\times \\$50M$\n\n$= 3.439\\% \\times \\$50M = \\$1,719,500$\n\nThe daily 1% VaR is approximately **$1.72 million**.

CVaR (Expected Shortfall) would tell us the average loss given that we have crossed the VaR threshold. For example, if CVaR is $2.8 million, it means that in the worst 1% of days, the average loss is $2.8 million \u2014 significantly worse than the $1.72 million VaR threshold. This tail risk information is critical for capital adequacy planning."
