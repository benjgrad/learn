It **cannot** be eliminated through diversification.\n\n**Unsystematic risk** (firm-specific risk, diversifiable risk) arises from factors unique to a company \u2014 management changes, product recalls, lawsuits. It **can** be eliminated by holding a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nAs you add more securities to a portfolio, unsystematic risk declines toward zero, but systematic risk remains. Because investors can eliminate unsystematic risk for free (by diversifying), the market only compensates investors for bearing systematic risk.\n\n### Beta: Measuring Systematic Risk\n\n$$\\beta_i = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\\sigma_m^2} = \\rho_{i,m} \\times \\frac{\\sigma_i}{\\sigma_m}$$\n\n| Beta Value | Interpretation |\n|---|---|\n| $\\beta = 1.0$ | Same systematic risk as the market |\n| $\\beta > 1.0$ | More sensitive than the market (aggressive) |\n| $\\beta < 1.0$ | Less sensitive than the market (defensive) |\n| $\\beta = 0$ | No systematic risk (e.g., risk-free asset) |"

Note that having a higher standard deviation (40% vs. 20%) does not automatically mean a high beta \u2014 the correlation matters. If the correlation were only 0.25, the beta would be 0.25 \u00d7 2.0 = 0.50, making it defensive despite its high total volatility."

      "content": "## The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n\nThe CAPM states that the expected return on any asset is determined solely by its systematic risk (beta):\n\n$$E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_i [E(R_m) - R_f]$$\n\nWhere:\n- $R_f$ = risk-free rate\n- $E(R_m)$ = expected market return\n- $E(R_m) - R_f$ = **market risk premium** (equity risk premium)\n- $\\beta_i [E(R_m) - R_f]$ = **risk premium** for asset $i$\n\n### Key CAPM Assumptions\n\n- Investors are risk-averse, utility-maximizing, and rational\n- Markets are frictionless (no taxes, no transaction costs)\n- All investors have the same one-period time horizon\n- All investors have homogeneous expectations\n- Investments are infinitely divisible\n- Investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate\n\n### The Security Market Line (SML)\n\nThe SML plots expected return against **beta** (not total risk). Every correctly priced asset should lie on the SML. An asset plotting **above** the SML is undervalued (positive alpha), while one plotting **below** is overvalued (negative alpha).\n\n### The Capital Market Line (CML)\n\nThe CML plots expected return against **total risk** (standard deviation) for efficient portfolios only \u2014 combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio. Its slope is the **Sharpe ratio** of the market portfolio:\n\n$$\\text{Slope of CML} = \\frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\\sigma_m}$$"
