          "explanation": "For callable bonds: Z-spread = OAS + Option cost. Since Z-spread (210) > OAS (180), option cost = 30 bps. The positive option cost indicates the embedded option benefits the issuer (a call option). For putable bonds, the OAS would exceed the Z-spread because the option benefits the bondholder. If no embedded options, Z-spread would approximately equal OAS.",
