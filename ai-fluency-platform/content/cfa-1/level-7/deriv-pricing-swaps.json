      "content": "## Interest Rate Swaps\n\nA **plain vanilla interest rate swap** is an agreement to exchange **fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments** on a notional principal over a specified period.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Notional principal** \u2014 the reference amount for calculating payments (not exchanged)\n- **Fixed-rate payer** \u2014 pays fixed, receives floating (effectively \"long\" the floating rate)\n- **Floating-rate payer** \u2014 pays floating, receives fixed (effectively \"long\" the fixed rate)\n- **Settlement** \u2014 typically **netted**: only the difference between fixed and floating is paid\n\n### Swap as a Series of Forwards\n\nEach payment date in a swap can be viewed as a **forward rate agreement (FRA)**. A 3-year annual swap is equivalent to three FRAs \u2014 one for each settlement date. The swap rate is set so that the present value of fixed payments equals the present value of expected floating payments.\n\n### The Swap Rate\n\nThe **swap rate** is the fixed rate that makes the swap have **zero value at initiation**:\n\n$$PV(\\text{fixed payments}) = PV(\\text{floating payments})$$\n\nUsing discount factors $d_i$ for each payment date:\n\n$$r_{\\text{swap}} = \\frac{1 - d_n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i}$$\n\nWhere $d_i = \\frac{1}{(1 + r_i)^i}$ are the discount factors from the zero curve."

      "question": "In a plain vanilla interest rate swap, if SOFR rises above the swap fixed rate, who makes a net payment to whom?",
      "answer": "The floating-rate payer makes a net payment to the fixed-rate payer. The floating-rate payer owes SOFR \u00d7 notional, which exceeds the fixed rate \u00d7 notional. After netting, the difference flows from the floating payer to the fixed payer. Equivalently: the fixed-rate payer (who receives floating) benefits when rates rise."

      "content": "## Currency Swaps and Equity Swaps\n\n### Currency Swaps\n\nIn a **currency swap**, two parties exchange:\n1. **Principal amounts** in different currencies at initiation (at the current spot rate)\n2. **Periodic interest payments** in their respective currencies\n3. **Principal amounts** at maturity (at the original exchange rate)\n\nUnlike interest rate swaps, currency swaps **do exchange notional principal** (at the beginning and end).\n\n### Equity Swaps\n\nIn an **equity swap**, one party pays the return on an equity index (or stock) and receives either a fixed rate, a floating rate, or the return on a different equity index.\n\nExample: Party A pays the S&P 500 total return and receives SOFR + 50 bps on a $10 million notional.\n\n## Swap Valuation After Initiation\n\nAfter initiation, the swap's value changes as interest rates or underlying values move. For a fixed-rate payer in an interest rate swap:\n\n$$V_{\\text{swap}} = PV(\\text{remaining floating}) - PV(\\text{remaining fixed})$$\n\nIf rates have risen since initiation, the swap has **positive value** to the fixed-rate payer (receiving now-higher floating payments) and **negative value** to the floating-rate payer."
