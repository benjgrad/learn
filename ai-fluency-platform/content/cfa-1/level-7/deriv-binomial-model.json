They are mathematical weights that allow us to price the option by discounting the **expected payoff** (under risk-neutral probabilities) at the risk-free rate.\n\n### Option Price\n\n$$c = \\frac{\\pi_u \\times c_u + \\pi_d \\times c_d}{1 + r}$$\n\n$$p = \\frac{\\pi_u \\times p_u + \\pi_d \\times p_d}{1 + r}$$"

      "question": "Why can we price options without knowing the actual probability that the stock goes up? This seems impossible \u2014 how can the price not depend on the likelihood of each outcome?",
      "answer": "The key insight is replication. We can construct a portfolio of the stock and risk-free borrowing that exactly replicates the option's payoff in both states. Since the replicating portfolio produces the same payoff as the option regardless of which state occurs, the option must cost the same as the replicating portfolio \u2014 by the law of one price. The actual probabilities cancel out because the hedge works in both states. Risk-neutral probabilities are a mathematical convenience that produce the same price as the replication argument."
