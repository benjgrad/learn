      "content": "## What Is a Derivative?\n\nA **derivative** is a financial instrument whose value is **derived from** the value of an underlying asset, rate, or index. The underlying can be a stock, bond, commodity, currency, interest rate, or even another derivative.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- The derivative's payoff depends on the value of the underlying at a future date\n- Derivatives are **contracts between two parties** (a buyer and a seller)\n- They typically require little or no initial investment relative to the exposure gained (**leverage**)\n\n### Types of Underlyings\n\n| Underlying | Examples |\n|---|---|\n| Equities | Individual stocks, stock indices (S&P 500) |\n| Fixed Income | Government bonds, interest rates (SOFR, EURIBOR) |\n| Currencies | EUR/USD, GBP/JPY |\n| Commodities | Crude oil, gold, wheat, natural gas |\n| Credit | Credit default (reference entity's debt) |\n\n### Purposes of Derivatives\n\nDerivatives serve three primary economic functions:\n\n1. **Hedging** \u2014 transferring unwanted risk (e.g., a farmer locking in a crop price)\n2. **Speculation** \u2014 taking a directional view on price movements with leverage\n3. **Arbitrage** \u2014 exploiting mispricings between related instruments for risk-free profit"

      "question": "Why is a derivative described as a 'zero-sum game'? Who gains and who loses?",
      "answer": "A derivative is a zero-sum game because one party's gain is exactly the other party's loss. If a forward contract buyer profits $10 when the underlying rises, the seller loses $10. Unlike stocks, where both buyer and issuing company can benefit from growth, derivatives merely redistribute existing risk and return between counterparties. The total net payoff across both sides is always zero (ignoring transaction costs)."

      "content": "## Exchange-Traded vs. OTC Markets\n\n| Feature | Exchange-Traded | Over-the-Counter (OTC) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Standardization | Standardized contracts | Customized terms |\n| Counterparty risk | Clearinghouse guarantees | Direct exposure to counterparty |\n| Liquidity | Generally higher | Varies; can be illiquid |\n| Transparency | Public price discovery | Prices may be opaque |\n| Regulation | Heavily regulated | Less regulated (but increasing) |\n| Examples | Futures, listed options | Forwards, swaps, exotic options |\n\n### The Role of the Clearinghouse\n\nIn exchange-traded markets, a **central clearinghouse** (also called a central counterparty, or CCP) interposes itself between every buyer and seller. This means:\n- Each party faces the clearinghouse, not the original counterparty\n- The clearinghouse guarantees performance on both sides\n- **Counterparty credit risk** is virtually eliminated\n\n### Margin and Mark-to-Market\n\n**Initial margin** is a good-faith deposit required when entering a position. **Maintenance margin** is the minimum account balance that must be maintained. If the account falls below maintenance margin due to daily price changes, the trader receives a **margin call** and must deposit **variation margin** to restore the account.\n\nThis process of daily settlement is called **mark-to-market** \u2014 gains and losses are realized daily rather than only at contract expiration."

      "solution": "**1. Counterparty risk:** The OTC swap exposes the portfolio manager directly to the dealer's credit risk \u2014 if the dealer defaults, the manager may lose unrealized gains. The futures contract on the CME is guaranteed by the clearinghouse, virtually eliminating counterparty risk.\n\n**2. Liquidity risk:** The OTC swap is a customized bilateral contract that may be difficult to exit or transfer before maturity. The CME futures contract is standardized and traded on an exchange with many participants, making it easy to offset (close) the position at any time.\n\nNote: Post-2008 reforms have required many OTC swaps to be centrally cleared, reducing but not eliminating the difference in counterparty risk."

The trader must restore the account to the initial margin of $5,000, so variation margin = $5,000 \u2212 $3,500 = $1,500. Option A ($0) is wrong because the balance fell below maintenance margin.
