Customized, not traded on an exchange.\n- **Futures contract** \u2014 an exchange-traded, standardized forward contract with daily mark-to-market settlement.\n- **Swap** \u2014 a series of forward commitments: an agreement to exchange cash flows on multiple future dates (e.g., fixed rate for floating rate).\n\n### Contingent Claims\n\nOne party has the **right but not the obligation** to transact. The other party has the obligation if the right is exercised.\n\n- **Call option** \u2014 the right to **buy** the underlying at the strike price\n- **Put option** \u2014 the right to **sell** the underlying at the strike price\n\nThe option buyer pays a **premium** upfront for this right. The option seller (writer) receives the premium and bears the obligation.\n\n| Feature | Forward Commitment | Contingent Claim |\n|---|---|---|\n| Obligation | Both parties obligated | Only seller obligated |\n| Upfront cost | Zero (or near-zero) | Buyer pays premium |\n| Potential loss | Unlimited for both sides | Buyer limited to premium |"

      "answer": "The company gains. It agreed to buy EUR 1 million at $1.10/EUR (paying $1,100,000) when the market rate is $1.15/EUR (market cost would be $1,150,000). The gain is ($1.15 \u2212 $1.10) \u00d7 1,000,000 = $50,000. The counterparty loses the same $50,000 \u2014 confirming the zero-sum nature of forwards."

Most exchange-traded equity options are American. Most index options are European.\n\n### Long vs. Short Positions\n\n| Position | Forwards/Futures | Options |\n|---|---|---|\n| Long | Agrees to **buy** at future date | Buys the option (pays premium) |\n| Short | Agrees to **sell** at future date | Sells/writes the option (receives premium) |"
