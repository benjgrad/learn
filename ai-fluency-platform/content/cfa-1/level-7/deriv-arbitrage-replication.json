If they don't, an arbitrage opportunity exists.\n\n### Arbitrage\n\nArbitrage is a transaction that generates a **risk-free profit with no net investment**. The arbitrageur simultaneously buys the cheaper asset and sells the more expensive one, locking in the price difference.\n\n**Key properties of arbitrage:**\n- Zero net investment (self-financing)\n- Zero risk\n- Positive profit\n\nIn well-functioning markets, arbitrage opportunities are quickly exploited and eliminated. This is the **no-arbitrage principle** \u2014 the assumption that prices adjust so that no risk-free profit opportunities persist.\n\n### Replication\n\nA **replicating portfolio** is a combination of instruments that produces the exact same payoff as a target instrument. By the law of one price:\n\n$$\\text{Price of derivative} = \\text{Price of replicating portfolio}$$\n\nIf a derivative can be replicated using the underlying asset and borrowing/lending, then the derivative's fair price is determined by the cost of constructing the replicating portfolio."

      "question": "If a forward contract on a stock is priced too high relative to the cost of carry model, describe the arbitrage trade.",
      "answer": "If the forward price is too high: (1) sell (short) the overpriced forward, (2) buy the underlying stock in the spot market, and (3) borrow the purchase price at the risk-free rate. At expiration, deliver the stock under the forward contract, receive the forward price, and repay the loan. The profit equals the forward price minus the cost of the stock compounded at the risk-free rate. This is called 'cash-and-carry arbitrage.'"

      "content": "## The Cost of Carry Model\n\nThe **cost of carry** is the net cost of holding (carrying) the underlying asset until the derivative's expiration date. It determines the theoretical forward/futures price:\n\n$$F_0 = S_0 \\times e^{(r + s - y)T}$$\n\nOr in discrete compounding:\n\n$$F_0 = S_0 \\times (1 + r + s - y)^T$$\n\nWhere:\n- $F_0$ = forward price\n- $S_0$ = current spot price\n- $r$ = risk-free interest rate (financing cost)\n- $s$ = storage costs (as a percentage)\n- $y$ = convenience yield or income yield (dividends, coupons)\n- $T$ = time to expiration\n\n### Components of Carry Cost\n\n| Component | Effect on Forward Price | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| Financing cost ($r$) | Increases | Opportunity cost of capital tied up |\n| Storage costs ($s$) | Increases | Warehouse fees for commodities |\n| Income/yield ($y$) | Decreases | Dividends from stocks, coupons from bonds |\n| Convenience yield | Decreases | Benefit of holding physical commodity |\n\nThe forward price exceeds the spot price when carry costs exceed carry benefits. The forward price is below the spot price when carry benefits (dividends, convenience yield) exceed carry costs."

      "solution": "**No dividends:**\n\n$$F_0 = S_0 \\times (1 + r)^T = 100 \\times (1.05)^{0.5} = 100 \\times 1.02470 = \\$102.47$$\n\n**With 2% continuous dividend yield:**\n\n$$F_0 = S_0 \\times e^{(r - y)T} = 100 \\times e^{(0.05 - 0.02)(0.5)} = 100 \\times e^{0.015} = 100 \\times 1.01511 = \\$101.51$$\n\nThe dividend yield reduces the forward price because the forward buyer does not receive dividends during the contract life. The spot holder earns dividends, reducing the forward holder's relative carrying cost."
