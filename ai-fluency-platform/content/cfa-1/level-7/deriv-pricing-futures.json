      "content": "## Futures vs. Forward Prices\n\nFutures and forwards are conceptually similar \u2014 both are agreements to buy/sell an asset at a future date. However, **daily settlement** creates a key difference.\n\n### Daily Settlement (Mark-to-Market)\n\nFutures contracts are settled daily. Each day, the clearinghouse calculates the gain or loss based on the change in the futures price, and cash is transferred between accounts.\n\n**Example:** A trader is long one oil futures contract (1,000 barrels) at $75.\n\n| Day | Settlement Price | Daily Gain/Loss | Account Balance |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | $75.00 | \u2014 | $5,000 (initial margin) |\n| 1 | $76.50 | +$1,500 | $6,500 |\n| 2 | $74.00 | \u2212$2,500 | $4,000 |\n| 3 | $75.50 | +$1,500 | $5,500 |\n\nGains are credited and can be withdrawn; losses are debited and may trigger margin calls.\n\n### When Do Futures and Forward Prices Differ?\n\nIf interest rates are **constant** (or uncorrelated with the underlying), futures and forward prices are theoretically identical. When interest rates are **positively correlated** with the underlying (e.g., stock index futures), futures prices tend to be slightly **higher** than forward prices. The daily settlement allows the futures long to reinvest gains when rates are high and borrow at low rates when covering losses."

      "question": "If a trader's margin account falls below the maintenance margin, what must the trader do? What happens if the trader does not act?",
      "answer": "The trader receives a margin call and must deposit variation margin to bring the account back to the initial margin level (not just the maintenance level). If the trader fails to meet the margin call, the broker will close (liquidate) the position to limit further losses. This forced liquidation protects the clearinghouse and the counterparty from credit risk."

      "content": "## Margin Mechanics\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Initial margin** | Deposit required to open a futures position |\n| **Maintenance margin** | Minimum balance before a margin call is triggered |\n| **Variation margin** | Additional deposit required to restore balance to initial margin |\n| **Margin call** | Notification that the account has fallen below maintenance margin |\n\nTypically, maintenance margin is about **75% of initial margin**.\n\n## Convergence at Expiration\n\nAs a futures contract approaches expiration, the futures price must **converge** to the spot price:\n\n$$\\lim_{t \\to T} F_t = S_T$$\n\nIf $F_T > S_T$, an arbitrageur would short the futures and buy the spot, profiting from the difference. If $F_T < S_T$, the reverse trade applies. Arbitrage forces convergence.\n\n## Contango and Backwardation\n\n- **Contango**: futures price > spot price ($F_0 > S_0$). The futures curve slopes **upward**. Common when storage costs are significant and convenience yield is low.\n- **Backwardation**: futures price < spot price ($F_0 < S_0$). The futures curve slopes **downward**. Common when convenience yield is high (strong desire to hold the physical asset).\n\nNote: \"Normal contango\" and \"normal backwardation\" refer to the relationship between the futures price and the **expected future spot price**, which is a distinct concept."

      "solution": "**Starting account balance:** 10 \u00d7 $8,000 = $80,000\n\n**Day 1 loss:** (1,992 \u2212 2,000) \u00d7 100 oz \u00d7 10 contracts = (\u2212$8) \u00d7 1,000 = \u2212$8,000\n\n**Account balance after day 1:** $80,000 \u2212 $8,000 = $72,000\n\n**Maintenance margin requirement:** 10 \u00d7 $6,000 = $60,000\n\n**Margin call?** No. $72,000 > $60,000, so the account is above maintenance margin.\n\nIf gold had instead settled at $1,978 (a $22 decline), the loss would be $22,000, leaving a balance of $58,000 \u2014 below the $60,000 maintenance level.
