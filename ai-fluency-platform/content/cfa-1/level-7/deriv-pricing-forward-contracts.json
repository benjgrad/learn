It is set so that the forward contract has **zero value at initiation**.\n- **Forward value** ($V_t$) \u2014 the market value of an existing forward contract at time $t$ after initiation.

      "answer": "The forward buyer does not receive dividends during the contract life \u2014 only the spot holder does. To make the forward contract fair (zero value at initiation), the forward price must be reduced to compensate the buyer for the foregone dividends. Mathematically, we subtract the present value of dividends from the spot price before compounding forward: F\u2080 = (S\u2080 \u2212 PV(D)) \u00d7 (1 + r)^T."
