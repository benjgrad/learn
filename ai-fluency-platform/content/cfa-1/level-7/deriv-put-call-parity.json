By the law of one price, they must have the **same cost today**:\n\n$$c + PV(X) = p + S$$\n\nThis is **put-call parity** for European options on non-dividend-paying stocks.\n\n### With Dividends\n\nFor stocks paying known dividends with present value $PV(D)$:\n\n$$c + PV(X) = p + S - PV(D)$$\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n$$c + PV(X) + PV(D) = p + S$$"
