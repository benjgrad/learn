A firm believes that if it raises its price, competitors will not follow (demand is elastic above the current price), but if it lowers its price, competitors will match the cut (demand is inelastic below the current price). This creates a kink at the current price and a discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve, meaning moderate changes in marginal cost may not alter the profit-maximizing price.",
