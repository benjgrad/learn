For a U.S. investor, USD/EUR = 1.10 means $1.10 per euro.\n- **Indirect quote** (quantity quotation): The foreign currency price of one unit of domestic currency. For a U.S. investor, EUR/USD = 0.909 means 0.909 euros per dollar.\n\nDirect and indirect quotes are reciprocals:\n\n$$\\text{Direct quote} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Indirect quote}}$$\n\n**CFA Convention**: The CFA exam typically quotes as \"A/B\" meaning the price of one unit of currency B in terms of currency A. So USD/EUR = 1.10 means 1.10 USD per 1 EUR.\n\n### Appreciation and Depreciation\n\nIf USD/EUR moves from 1.10 to 1.15:\n- The EUR has **appreciated** (it costs more USD to buy one EUR)\n- The USD has **depreciated** (each USD buys fewer EUR)\n\nPercentage change in the value of the EUR:\n\n$$\\% \\Delta = \\frac{1.15 - 1.10}{1.10} = \\frac{0.05}{1.10} = 4.55\\%$$\n\nThe euro appreciated by 4.55% against the dollar."

      "question": "If GBP/USD = 1.25 (meaning 1.25 GBP per 1 USD), and the rate changes to GBP/USD = 1.30, has the U.S. dollar appreciated or depreciated against the British pound?",
      "answer": "The U.S. dollar has appreciated. The quote GBP/USD = 1.30 means it now costs 1.30 GBP to buy one USD, up from 1.25 GBP. Since the dollar buys more pounds than before, it has strengthened (appreciated). Conversely, the pound has depreciated \u2014 it now takes more pounds to purchase one dollar. The dollar appreciated by (1.30 \u2212 1.25)/1.25 = 4.0% against the pound."

      "content": "## Cross Rates\n\nA **cross rate** is the exchange rate between two currencies derived from their exchange rates with a common third currency.\n\n### Calculating Cross Rates\n\nGiven USD/EUR = 1.10 and USD/JPY = 150 (both quoted as units of USD):\n\nTo find JPY/EUR (yen per euro):\n\n$$\\text{JPY/EUR} = \\frac{\\text{USD/EUR}}{\\text{USD/JPY}} = \\frac{1.10}{1/150}$$\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a chain: EUR \u2192 USD \u2192 JPY.\n\n$$1 \\text{ EUR} = 1.10 \\text{ USD} = 1.10 \\times 150 \\text{ JPY} = 165 \\text{ JPY}$$\n\nSo JPY/EUR = 165 (one euro costs 165 yen).\n\n### General Rule for Cross Rates\n\nTo find A/B, use a common currency C:\n\n$$\\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{A}{C} \\times \\frac{C}{B}$$\n\nThe common currency (C) cancels out algebraically.\n\n### Bid-Ask Spreads\n\nDealers quote two prices:\n- **Bid**: The price at which the dealer will **buy** the base currency (you sell at this price)\n- **Ask (offer)**: The price at which the dealer will **sell** the base currency (you buy at this price)\n\nThe ask is always higher than the bid. The **spread** is the dealer's profit:\n\n$$\\text{Spread} = \\text{Ask} - \\text{Bid}$$\n\n$$\\text{Spread \\%} = \\frac{\\text{Ask} - \\text{Bid}}{\\text{Ask}} \\times 100$$\n\n**Example**: USD/EUR bid-ask = 1.0990/1.1010\n- To **buy euros** (sell dollars), you pay 1.1010 USD per EUR (the ask)\n- To **sell euros** (buy dollars), you receive 1.0990 USD per EUR (the bid)\n- Spread = 1.1010 \u2212 1.0990 = 0.0020 USD (20 pips)"

      "content": "## Forward Rates and Interest Rate Parity\n\n### Forward Exchange Rates\n\nA **forward rate** is the rate agreed today for a currency exchange at a future date. Forward rates differ from spot rates due to **interest rate differentials** between the two currencies.\n\n$$F = S \\times \\frac{1 + r_d}{1 + r_f}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $F$ = forward rate (domestic per foreign)\n- $S$ = spot rate (domestic per foreign)\n- $r_d$ = domestic interest rate for the period\n- $r_f$ = foreign interest rate for the period\n\n### Forward Premium and Discount\n\n- **Forward premium**: The foreign currency is more expensive in the forward market than the spot market ($F > S$). This occurs when the domestic interest rate exceeds the foreign rate.\n- **Forward discount**: The foreign currency is cheaper in the forward market ($F < S$). This occurs when the foreign interest rate exceeds the domestic rate.\n\n$$\\text{Forward premium/discount} = \\frac{F - S}{S} \\times 100$$\n\n### Example\n\nSpot USD/EUR = 1.1000. U.S. rate = 5%, Eurozone rate = 3% (both annual). One-year forward:\n\n$$F = 1.1000 \\times \\frac{1.05}{1.03} = 1.1000 \\times 1.01942 = 1.1214$$\n\nThe euro trades at a **forward premium** of $(1.1214 - 1.1000)/1.1000 = 1.94\\%$. The higher-rate currency (USD) is expected to depreciate \u2014 this prevents arbitrage.\n\n### Interest Rate Parity (IRP)\n\n**Covered interest rate parity (CIRP)**: Using the forward market to eliminate exchange rate risk, an investor should earn the same return investing domestically or abroad. CIRP is enforced by **arbitrage** and holds very closely in practice.\n\n**Uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP)**: The expected future spot rate equals the forward rate. Higher-yielding currencies are expected to depreciate by the interest rate differential. UIRP is a theory \u2014 it does not hold consistently in practice (the \"forward rate bias\" or \"carry trade\" anomaly)."

The USD trades at a **forward discount** against the CHF.\n\nThis makes sense: the U.S. has higher interest rates, so the USD should depreciate (per interest rate parity) to prevent arbitrage.\n\n**c) Annualized forward premium/discount:**\n\n$$\\text{6-month discount} = \\frac{0.9132 - 0.9200}{0.9200} = \\frac{-0.0068}{0.9200} = -0.739\\%$$\n\n$$\\text{Annualized} = -0.739\\% \\times 2 = -1.48\\%$$\n\nThe USD trades at an annualized forward discount of approximately 1.48% against the CHF."
