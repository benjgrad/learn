      "content": "## Central Banking and the Money Supply\n\n### Roles of a Central Bank\n\nCentral banks serve several critical functions:\n- **Monetary policy**: Setting interest rates and controlling money supply to achieve price stability and support economic growth\n- **Lender of last resort**: Providing emergency liquidity to banks facing short-term funding crises\n- **Bank regulation and supervision**: Ensuring stability of the financial system\n- **Currency issuance**: Managing the nation's currency and payment systems\n\n### Money Supply and the Money Multiplier\n\nThe central bank controls the **monetary base** (currency in circulation plus bank reserves). Through the banking system, this base is multiplied into a larger money supply via the **money multiplier**:\n\n$$\\text{Money multiplier} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Reserve requirement}}$$\n\n**Example**: If the reserve requirement is 10%, the money multiplier is $1/0.10 = 10$. A $1 billion increase in the monetary base can support up to $10 billion in new money supply.\n\nIn practice, the actual multiplier is smaller because banks may hold **excess reserves** and the public holds some currency outside the banking system.\n\n### Money Demand\n\nPeople hold money for three reasons (Keynes):\n- **Transactions demand**: To fund daily purchases (increases with income and GDP)\n- **Precautionary demand**: As a buffer against unexpected expenses\n- **Speculative demand**: To take advantage of future investment opportunities (decreases as interest rates rise, because the opportunity cost of holding money increases)"

      "question": "If the central bank lowers the reserve requirement from 10% to 5%, what happens to the theoretical money multiplier and the money supply?",
      "answer": "The money multiplier doubles from 10 (1/0.10) to 20 (1/0.05). This means each dollar of reserves can now support $20 in deposits instead of $10. The potential money supply expands significantly because banks can lend a larger fraction of their deposits. In practice, the expansion would be smaller if banks choose to hold excess reserves or if loan demand is weak. This is an expansionary monetary policy action \u2014 by reducing reserves banks must hold, the central bank increases the funds available for lending."

      "content": "## Policy Frameworks\n\n### Inflation Targeting\n\nMost major central banks now explicitly target a specific inflation rate (commonly **2%**). The framework involves:\n- Announcing a numerical inflation target\n- Using the policy rate as the primary instrument\n- Publishing inflation forecasts and minutes to maintain transparency\n- Central bank **independence** from political pressure\n\nThe target is typically symmetric: 2% inflation is the goal, and both above-target and below-target inflation are considered undesirable.\n\n### The Taylor Rule\n\nThe Taylor rule provides a formula for determining the appropriate policy interest rate:\n\n$$i = r^* + \\pi + 0.5(\\pi - \\pi^*) + 0.5(y - y^*)$$\n\nWhere:\n- $i$ = target nominal policy rate\n- $r^*$ = real equilibrium interest rate (commonly assumed at 2%)\n- $\\pi$ = current inflation rate\n- $\\pi^*$ = target inflation rate\n- $y - y^*$ = output gap (actual GDP minus potential GDP, as a percentage)\n\n**Example**: Assume $r^* = 2\\%$, $\\pi = 3\\%$, $\\pi^* = 2\\%$, and the output gap is $+1\\%$:\n\n$$i = 2\\% + 3\\% + 0.5(3\\% - 2\\%) + 0.5(1\\%) = 2 + 3 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 6\\%$$\n\nThe Taylor rule suggests a 6% policy rate. If the actual rate is lower, the central bank may be running a policy that is too expansionary.\n\n### Limitations of Monetary Policy\n\n- **Liquidity trap**: At very low interest rates, further rate cuts have little effect \u2014 people hoard cash rather than spend or invest\n- **Long and variable lags**: Monetary policy affects the real economy with delays of 6\u201324 months\n- **Pushing on a string**: The central bank can make borrowing cheaper, but cannot force businesses and consumers to borrow and spend"

      "title": "Using the Taylor rule, calculate the recommended policy rate given: equilibrium real rate = 2%, current inflation = 4%, target inflation = 2%, actual GDP growth = 1%, potential GDP growth = 3% (output gap = -2%). Then explain whether the central bank should adopt an expansionary or contractionary stance.",
      "solution": "**Taylor rule calculation:**\n\n$$i = r^* + \\pi + 0.5(\\pi - \\pi^*) + 0.5(y - y^*)$$\n\n$$i = 2\\% + 4\\% + 0.5(4\\% - 2\\%) + 0.5(-2\\%)$$\n\n$$i = 2 + 4 + 1 - 1 = 6\\%$$\n\n**Interpretation**: The Taylor rule recommends a 6% policy rate. The two objectives pull in opposite directions:\n\n- **Inflation above target** (+1% contribution): Inflation is 4% vs. the 2% target, calling for tighter policy\n- **Negative output gap** (\u22121% contribution): GDP is below potential, calling for easier policy\n\nThe net recommendation of 6% is still above what a pure inflation-neutral stance (2% + 4% = 6%) would suggest, because the inflation overshoot exactly offsets the output gap in this case. The central bank faces a trade-off: tightening to control inflation risks worsening the output gap. This is similar to the stagflation dilemma \u2014 the optimal response depends on which objective the central bank prioritizes."
