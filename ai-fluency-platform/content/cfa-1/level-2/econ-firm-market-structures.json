      "content": "## Market Structure Overview\n\nMarket structure describes the competitive environment in which firms operate. The CFA curriculum identifies **four market structures** along a spectrum of pricing power:\n\n| Feature | Perfect Competition | Monopolistic Competition | Oligopoly | Pure Monopoly |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Number of firms | Very many | Many | Few | One |\n| Barriers to entry | None | Low | High | Very high |\n| Product | Identical | Differentiated | Identical or differentiated | Unique |\n| Pricing power | None | Some | Some to significant | Significant |\n| Long-run economic profit | Zero | Zero | Possible | Possible |\n\n### Perfect Competition\n\nIn perfect competition, firms are **price takers** \u2014 they accept the market price and can sell any quantity at that price. The demand curve facing each firm is **perfectly elastic** (horizontal). Key conditions include: many buyers and sellers, homogeneous products, free entry and exit, and perfect information.\n\nA perfectly competitive firm maximizes profit by producing where **marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC)**. Since the firm is a price taker, $MR = P$, so the profit-maximizing rule becomes:\n\n$$P = MR = MC$$\n\nIn the long run, economic profit attracts new entrants, increasing supply until price falls to the minimum of average total cost (ATC), yielding **zero economic profit**."

      "question": "A perfectly competitive firm is earning positive economic profits in the short run. What will happen in the long run, and why?",
      "answer": "New firms will enter the market, attracted by the positive economic profits. Entry increases market supply, which pushes the market price downward. This continues until price equals the minimum of average total cost (ATC), and economic profit falls to zero. At that point, there is no further incentive for new firms to enter. Note that zero economic profit still means the firm earns a normal accounting profit \u2014 enough to cover all opportunity costs."

      "content": "## Shutdown and Breakeven Analysis\n\n### Short-Run Shutdown Decision\n\nA firm should continue operating in the short run as long as it can cover its **variable costs**. Even if the firm is losing money, it loses less by operating than by shutting down (since fixed costs must be paid regardless).\n\n- **Breakeven point**: $P = ATC$ (total revenue covers all costs)\n- **Shutdown point**: $P = AVC$ (total revenue just covers variable costs)\n- If $P < AVC$: the firm should shut down \u2014 losses exceed fixed costs\n- If $AVC \\leq P < ATC$: the firm operates at a loss but covers some fixed costs\n- If $P \\geq ATC$: the firm earns economic profit\n\n### Economies and Diseconomies of Scale\n\nThe long-run average total cost (LRATC) curve is U-shaped due to:\n\n- **Economies of scale**: As output increases, LRATC falls. Sources include specialization, bulk purchasing, and spreading fixed costs.\n- **Constant returns to scale**: LRATC is flat \u2014 output and costs increase proportionally.\n- **Diseconomies of scale**: Beyond a certain point, LRATC rises. Causes include coordination problems, bureaucracy, and communication breakdowns.\n\nThe **minimum efficient scale (MES)** is the smallest output level at which LRATC is minimized. Industries with high MES relative to market demand tend toward fewer, larger firms (oligopoly or monopoly)."

      "content": "## Monopolistic Competition, Oligopoly, and Monopoly\n\n### Monopolistic Competition\n\nFirms sell **differentiated products** (branding, quality, location) but face many competitors. Each firm has a downward-sloping demand curve and some pricing power. Short-run profits are possible, but free entry drives long-run economic profit to **zero** \u2014 similar to perfect competition, but firms produce at a point above minimum ATC (excess capacity).\n\n### Oligopoly\n\nA market dominated by a **few large firms** whose actions are interdependent. Key models include:\n\n- **Kinked demand curve**: Competitors match price decreases but not increases, creating price rigidity\n- **Cournot model**: Firms choose quantities simultaneously; equilibrium output is between competitive and monopoly levels\n- **Nash equilibrium**: Each firm's strategy is optimal given the other firms' strategies\n- **Prisoner's dilemma**: Firms have incentives to cheat on collusive agreements\n\n### Pure Monopoly\n\nA single seller faces the entire market demand curve. The monopolist maximizes profit where $MR = MC$, but charges a price **above MC** (read from the demand curve). This creates **deadweight loss** \u2014 a reduction in total economic welfare.\n\n$$MR = P\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{|E_d|}\\right)$$\n\nWhere $E_d$ is the price elasticity of demand. A monopolist always operates on the **elastic portion** of the demand curve (where $|E_d| > 1$), because MR is positive only in this range.\n\n### Measuring Market Concentration\n\n- **N-firm concentration ratio**: Sum of market shares of the N largest firms (e.g., four-firm CR)\n- **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)**: Sum of squared market shares of all firms\n\n$$HHI = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i^2$$\n\nWhere $s_i$ is the market share of firm $i$ expressed as a percentage. HHI ranges from near 0 (perfect competition) to 10,000 (pure monopoly). A market with HHI above 2,500 is considered highly concentrated."

Combined with a CR4 of 92%, this market exhibits significant concentration and likely oligopolistic behavior. Regulators would scrutinize any proposed merger among these firms."
