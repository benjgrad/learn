      "content": "## The Balance of Payments\n\nThe **balance of payments (BOP)** is an accounting record of all economic transactions between a country's residents and the rest of the world over a period. It must always sum to zero by construction.\n\n### BOP Components\n\n| Account | Records | Key Items |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Current account** | Trade in goods and services, income, and transfers | Exports/imports of goods, services, investment income, remittances |\n| **Capital account** | Transfers of capital assets and non-financial assets | Debt forgiveness, migrant transfers, sale of patents |\n| **Financial account** | Investment flows | Foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, reserve assets, other investment |\n\nThe fundamental identity:\n\n$$\\text{Current account} + \\text{Capital account} + \\text{Financial account} = 0$$\n\n### Current Account Details\n\nThe current account is the most watched component:\n\n$$\\text{Current account} = (X - M) + \\text{Net income} + \\text{Net transfers}$$\n\nWhere $X$ = exports, $M$ = imports.\n\n- **Trade balance** ($X - M$): The largest component. A deficit means imports exceed exports.\n- **Net income**: Investment income received from abroad minus income paid to foreign investors\n- **Net transfers**: Remittances, foreign aid, gifts\n\nA **current account deficit** means the country consumes more than it produces. To finance this, it must attract capital inflows (a financial account surplus). In other words, a trade deficit is financed by foreign investment \u2014 borrowing from or selling assets to foreigners."

      "question": "The United States has run persistent current account deficits for decades. What does this imply about the financial account, and why might this be sustainable?",
      "answer": "A persistent current account deficit implies a persistent financial account surplus \u2014 the U.S. attracts net capital inflows. Foreign investors buy U.S. assets (Treasury bonds, equities, real estate, direct investments). This can be sustainable because: (1) the U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency, creating constant demand for U.S. assets; (2) U.S. financial markets are deep, liquid, and considered safe; (3) the U.S. economy is large and innovative, offering attractive investment returns. However, sustainability depends on continued foreign willingness to hold U.S. assets. If confidence erodes, capital inflows could slow, the dollar could depreciate, and financing the deficit would become more expensive."

      "content": "## The Foreign Exchange Market\n\n### Market Structure\n\nThe FX market is the **largest financial market in the world**, with daily turnover exceeding $7 trillion. Key features:\n\n- **Over-the-counter (OTC)**: No centralized exchange; trading occurs through a network of banks, dealers, and electronic platforms\n- **24-hour trading**: Follows the sun across major financial centers (London, New York, Tokyo)\n- **Participants**: Central banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, corporations, retail traders\n- **Settlement**: Most spot trades settle in two business days (T+2)\n\n### Exchange Rate Quotation\n\nAn exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another:\n\n- **EUR/USD = 1.10** means 1 euro costs 1.10 U.S. dollars\n- The first currency (EUR) is the **base currency**\n- The second currency (USD) is the **quote (price) currency**\n\nWhen EUR/USD rises from 1.10 to 1.15, the euro has **appreciated** (it buys more dollars) and the dollar has **depreciated** (it costs more dollars to buy one euro).\n\n### Factors Affecting Exchange Rates\n\n- **Interest rate differentials**: Higher rates attract capital inflows, strengthening the currency\n- **Inflation differentials**: Higher inflation weakens the currency (purchasing power parity)\n- **Economic growth**: Strong growth attracts investment, supporting the currency\n- **Current account balance**: Surpluses create demand for the domestic currency\n- **Political stability**: Instability causes capital flight and currency depreciation\n- **Market sentiment and speculation**: Short-term flows driven by expectations"

      "content": "## Exchange Rate Regimes\n\nCountries choose how their exchange rate is determined:\n\n### Fixed (Pegged) Exchange Rate\n\nThe central bank commits to maintaining the exchange rate at a specific level (or within a narrow band). To defend the peg:\n- **Currency under depreciation pressure**: Central bank sells foreign reserves and buys domestic currency\n- **Currency under appreciation pressure**: Central bank buys foreign reserves and sells domestic currency\n\n**Advantages**: Reduces exchange rate uncertainty for trade, provides a nominal anchor for inflation.\n**Disadvantages**: Requires large foreign reserves, limits monetary policy independence, vulnerable to speculative attacks if markets doubt the peg's sustainability.\n\n### Floating Exchange Rate\n\nThe exchange rate is determined by market forces of supply and demand without central bank intervention.\n\n**Advantages**: Automatic adjustment mechanism (deficits cause depreciation, boosting exports), monetary policy independence.\n**Disadvantages**: Exchange rate volatility creates uncertainty for businesses, may overshoot fundamental values.\n\n### Managed Float\n\nA hybrid where the rate is primarily market-determined, but the central bank intervenes occasionally to smooth volatility or prevent misalignment. Most major economies use this approach.\n\n### The Impossible Trinity (Trilemma)\n\nA country cannot simultaneously achieve all three of:\n1. **Free capital mobility**\n2. **Fixed exchange rate**\n3. **Independent monetary policy**\n\nA country can only choose **two of the three**. For example, the Eurozone has a fixed exchange rate (shared currency) and free capital mobility, but member countries gave up independent monetary policy. The U.S. has free capital mobility and independent monetary policy, but a floating exchange rate.\n\n### Central Bank Intervention\n\nWhen central banks intervene in FX markets:\n- **Unsterilized intervention**: Buying/selling foreign currency changes the domestic money supply (buying foreign currency with newly created domestic currency increases money supply)\n- **Sterilized intervention**: The central bank offsets the money supply effect with domestic open market operations (buying foreign currency but simultaneously selling domestic bonds)"
