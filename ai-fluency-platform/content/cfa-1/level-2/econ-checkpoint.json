          "explanation": "When P = ATC, total revenue (P \u00d7 Q) equals total cost (ATC \u00d7 Q), so economic profit is zero. This is the long-run equilibrium condition in perfect competition. Zero economic profit means the firm earns a normal return \u2014 enough to cover all explicit and implicit costs (including opportunity costs). Option A requires P > ATC. Option C requires P < AVC (at the shutdown point, losses equal fixed costs).",

Option A describes contradictory conditions \u2014 rising unemployment is characteristic of contraction, not expansion. While stock prices are a leading indicator and may rise early in expansion, the combination with rising unemployment is inconsistent. Option C describes contraction characteristics (rising unemployment, falling inflation) combined with a fiscal response (rising government spending).",

Effect of spending: 4 \u00d7 $40B = $160B. Effect of taxes: \u22123 \u00d7 $40B = \u2212$120B. Net: $160B \u2212 $120B = $40B. The balanced-budget multiplier is always 1: net GDP change = the equal increase in spending and taxes. Option A assumes the effects cancel completely, ignoring that the spending multiplier exceeds the tax multiplier in absolute value. Option C (120B) uses only the spending multiplier effect on the net amount: 3 \u00d7 $40B, confusing multipliers.",

Both inflation below target (\u22120.5%) and the negative output gap (\u22121.5%) call for easier policy, pulling the recommended rate well below the neutral rate (r* + \u03c0* = 4%). Option B (2.0%) omits the output gap term: 2 + 1 \u2212 0.5 = 2.5, not 2.0, so this would also involve a computational error.

Investors flee to safety: demand for safe-haven government bonds rises, pushing their prices up and yields down. Gold, as a traditional safe-haven asset, also appreciates. Option A reverses almost all effects \u2014 oil prices would rise (not fall), equities would decline (not rise), and credit spreads would widen (not narrow).

Therefore: \u2212180 + 10 + Financial = 0, so Financial = +$170B. Option B (+$180B) ignores the capital account surplus, setting Financial = \u2212Current account = +$180B.

The euro trades at a forward premium because U.S. rates are higher (the USD, as the higher-rate currency, trades at a forward discount, meaning each EUR costs more USD forward). Option A (1.0644) results from inverting the ratio: 1.0800 \u00d7 (1.035/1.05) = 1.0800 \u00d7 0.98571 = 1.0646 \u2014 putting the EUR rate in the numerator instead of the denominator.
