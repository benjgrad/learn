      "content": "# Level 5: AI System Engineer\n\nLevel 5 represents the stage of mastery where a professional understands the deep architecture that powers modern AI *and* can design multi-component systems that put that understanding to work. An AI System Engineer knows not just *how* to use models, but *why* they behave the way they do -- and can leverage that understanding to build, evaluate, fine-tune, and orchestrate sophisticated AI systems.\n\n## What You Will Learn\n\nThis level covers two complementary halves:\n\n### Part 1: Understanding AI Internals (5.1-5.5)\n\n1. **Transformer Architecture** -- The encoder-decoder structure, positional encoding, and the architecture behind \"Attention Is All You Need.\"\n\n2. **Attention Mechanism** -- Query, Key, and Value vectors, multi-head attention, and how models decide what to focus on.\n\n3. **Fine-Tuning** -- LoRA, QLoRA, RLHF, and domain adaptation techniques for customizing models to specialized tasks.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics** -- BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, human evaluation, and building rigorous benchmark suites.\n\n5. **Agentic Workflows** -- ReAct prompting, tool use, multi-agent systems, and orchestration patterns for autonomous AI behavior.\n\n### Part 2: Designing Multi-Component AI Systems (5.6-5.9)\n\n6. **Orchestration Frameworks** -- Comparing LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, and n8n for building multi-step AI workflows, plus when to use frameworks versus custom code.\n\n7. **Human-in-the-Loop Design** -- Designing effective human oversight with confidence-based routing, escalation thresholds, and strategies to prevent approval fatigue.\n\n8. **Multi-AI System Architecture** -- Separation of concerns with router, specialist, and evaluator models, plus SLIs and SLOs for probabilistic systems.\n\n9. **System-Level Cost and Performance** -- Token budgets, batch versus real-time inference, cost accounting across multi-model pipelines, and optimization strategies.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou should have completed all Level 4 content and be comfortable with:\n\n- Treating AI as a software component with typed interfaces (Level 4)\n- Engineering patterns for reliability and cost (Level 4)\n- API integration and deterministic wrappers (Level 4)\n- A basic understanding of linear algebra (Foundations)\n\n## The Two-Part Journey"

      "content": "At Level 4, you learned to engineer *around* AI's probabilistic nature. Level 5 is a two-part journey:\n\n**Part 1 (Modules 5.1-5.5)** takes you *inside* the model. Understanding transformers and attention mechanisms is not just academic -- it directly informs prompt design, model selection, fine-tuning decisions, and debugging. You will learn why models behave the way they do, then apply that understanding to agentic workflows where AI reasons, uses tools, and takes multi-step actions.\n\n**Part 2 (Modules 5.6-5.9)** takes you *above* the model. Once you understand individual models deeply, you are ready to design systems where multiple models collaborate -- with routers directing traffic, specialists handling domains, evaluators ensuring quality, and humans providing oversight where it matters. These modules cover the engineering of multi-component AI systems: choosing the right frameworks, designing effective human oversight, architecting multi-model pipelines, and managing cost and performance at the system level.\n\nTogether, these two halves make you an engineer who can work at every level of the AI stack -- from attention weights to system architecture."

How might understanding transformer internals help you design better interfaces -- for instance, setting appropriate token limits, choosing temperature values, or predicting when a model will struggle? And how does that extend to designing boundaries between multiple models in a system?"
