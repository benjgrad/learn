      "content": "## Why run models locally?\n\nEvery time you use a cloud AI service, your prompt and the model's response travel across the internet to a remote data center. For many tasks this is fine. But there are situations where sending data to a third party is unacceptable:\n\n- **Regulated data**: Medical records, financial data, legal documents, or anything covered by HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, or similar frameworks\n- **Proprietary code**: Internal source code, trade secrets, or pre-release product information\n- **Personal privacy**: Journals, therapy notes, private communications\n- **Air-gapped environments**: Networks with no external internet access\n\nLocal models solve this by running the entire inference process on your own hardware. Your data never leaves your machine.\n\n### The tradeoff\n\nLocal models are smaller and less capable than frontier cloud models. A model that runs on a laptop typically has 7 to 13 billion parameters, compared to hundreds of billions (or more) for GPT-4 or Claude. This means local models are excellent for many practical tasks -- summarization, code completion, drafting, brainstorming -- but they struggle with complex reasoning, nuanced analysis, and tasks requiring broad world knowledge.\n\n## Ollama: the command-line approach\n\n**Ollama** is an open-source tool that makes running local models as simple as running a command. It handles model downloading, quantization, and serving behind a simple CLI.\n\n### Getting started\n\nInstallation is straightforward on macOS, Linux, and Windows:\n\n```bash\n# macOS / Linux\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n\n# Then run a model\nollama run llama3.2\n```\n\nThat single command downloads the model (if not already cached) and starts an interactive chat session. First run takes a few minutes to download; subsequent runs start in seconds.\n\n### Useful commands\n\n```bash\n# List downloaded models\nollama list\n\n# Pull a model without running it\nollama pull mistral\n\n# Run with a specific prompt\nollama run llama3.2 \"Summarize this text: ...\"\n\n# Serve as an API (compatible with OpenAI format)\nollama serve\n```\n\nThe API compatibility is particularly valuable: tools built for the OpenAI API can often be pointed at `http://localhost:11434` with minimal configuration changes.\n\n## LM Studio: the graphical approach\n\n**LM Studio** provides a desktop application with a visual interface for downloading, configuring, and chatting with local models. It is a good choice if you prefer a GUI over the command line, and it offers useful features like side-by-side model comparison and parameter adjustment sliders.\n\nLM Studio also runs a local API server, so you get the same integration benefits as Ollama with a more visual workflow for model management.\n\n## Hardware considerations\n\nLocal inference is computationally intensive. The key factor is **memory** -- specifically GPU VRAM or system RAM.\n\n### GPU versus CPU inference\n\n| Factor | GPU inference | CPU inference |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Speed | 30-100+ tokens/second | 5-15 tokens/second |\n| Requirements | NVIDIA GPU with 8+ GB VRAM | 16+ GB system RAM |\n| Model size limit | Limited by VRAM | Limited by system RAM |\n| Cost | Requires a discrete GPU | Works on any modern machine |\n\nGPU inference is dramatically faster. A 7B parameter model on a modern NVIDIA GPU generates text at conversational speed. The same model on CPU is usable but noticeably slower, roughly like watching someone type.\n\n### Quantization\n\nFull-precision models are too large for most consumer hardware. **Quantization** reduces model size by using lower-precision numbers (4-bit or 8-bit instead of 16-bit floating point). A 7B model at full precision needs approximately 14 GB of memory; at 4-bit quantization, it fits in approximately 4 GB with only modest quality loss.\n\nMost models available through Ollama and LM Studio are pre-quantized. You will see labels like `Q4_K_M` or `Q8_0` indicating the quantization level."

      "question": "If a local 7B parameter model gives you a confident answer about a complex legal question, should you trust it as much as you would trust GPT-4's answer to the same question?",
      "answer": "No. Smaller models are more prone to confident confabulation on topics requiring specialized knowledge. A 7B model may produce fluent, authoritative-sounding legal text that is factually wrong. The model's confidence has no correlation with its accuracy on expert-domain questions. For high-stakes queries, use the most capable model available and verify with authoritative sources regardless of which model you use."

      "content": "## When to use local versus cloud\n\n| Scenario | Recommendation | Reason |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Processing sensitive client data | Local | Data never leaves your machine |\n| Complex multi-step reasoning | Cloud | Frontier models are significantly more capable |\n| Quick code completion | Local | Fast enough, no API latency, free |\n| Creative writing with nuance | Cloud | Larger models handle subtlety better |\n| Offline or air-gapped work | Local | Only option without internet |\n| High-volume batch processing | Local | No per-token cost after hardware investment |\n| One-off complex analysis | Cloud | Not worth optimizing local setup for a single task |\n\n### Data governance implications\n\nRunning models locally does not automatically solve all data governance concerns. Consider:\n\n- **Model training data**: Open-source models were trained on public internet data, which may include copyrighted or biased content\n- **Output logging**: Ensure your local setup does not inadvertently log sensitive prompts to disk in plaintext\n- **Model provenance**: Download models from trusted sources (Hugging Face, Ollama's official library) to avoid tampered weights\n- **Compliance documentation**: If you are using local models for regulated work, document your setup for audit purposes"

      "solution": "You should notice that the local model produces a reasonable response for straightforward tasks but may fall short on complex or nuanced questions. Speed depends on your hardware -- GPU users will see fast responses while CPU-only users will notice a delay. The key observation is that the interaction feels identical to a cloud service, but nothing left your machine."
