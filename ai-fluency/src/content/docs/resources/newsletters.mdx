## Curated Intelligence, Delivered

In a field where the landscape shifts weekly, newsletters are the most efficient way to maintain situational awareness. The best AI newsletters distill hundreds of papers, product launches, and debates into actionable summaries that take minutes to read.

### Essential Newsletters

### Building Your Newsletter Stack

Not all newsletters serve the same purpose. Build a stack that covers awareness, depth, and specialization:

| Purpose | Newsletter | Frequency | Time Investment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily awareness** | The Neuron or Superhuman AI | Daily | 5 minutes |
| **Weekly synthesis** | The Batch or Ben's Bites | Weekly | 10 minutes |
| **Technical depth** | Import AI or Ahead of AI | Weekly/Monthly | 15-20 minutes |
| **Safety/alignment** | The Alignment Newsletter | Bi-weekly | 10 minutes |

### Managing Information Overload

Subscribing to everything defeats the purpose. Follow these principles:

1. **Start with two**: One daily digest for breadth, one weekly deep-dive for depth
2. **Timebox your reading**: Set a specific time (morning coffee, lunch break) and a time limit (15 minutes)
3. **Act on one thing per week**: Reading is only valuable if it changes your behavior. Each week, identify one insight to apply to your work
4. **Prune quarterly**: Unsubscribe from any newsletter you have not read in the past month. Your time is worth more than inbox guilt

<KeyTakeaway>
Newsletters are the connective tissue of AI fluency -- they keep you aware of the field's rapid evolution with minimal time investment. Choose two or three that match your level and interests, read them consistently, and act on what you learn. Awareness without action is just entertainment.
