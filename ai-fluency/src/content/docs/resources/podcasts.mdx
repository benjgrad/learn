### Suggested Listening Schedule

| Day | Podcast Type | Duration | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Daily | AI Daily Brief | 10-15 min | Stay informed on breaking news |
| Monday | Latent Space or Practical AI | 45-60 min | Engineering deep dive |
| Wednesday | Cognitive Revolution or TWIML | 45-60 min | Research and strategy perspective |
| Weekend | Lex Fridman (when relevant) | 2-3 hours | Deep exploration of a single topic |

<KeyTakeaway>
Podcasts are uniquely effective for absorbing diverse perspectives and staying current. Build a rotation that covers both technical depth (Latent Space, TWIML) and strategic breadth (Cognitive Revolution, Lex Fridman). A 30-minute daily listening habit compounds into hundreds of hours of expert insight over a year.
