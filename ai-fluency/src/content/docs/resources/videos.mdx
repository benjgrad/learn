### Recommended Viewing Path

| Your Level | Start With | Then Watch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Level 1-2 | 3Blue1Brown's neural network series | DeepLearning.AI's concept explainers |
| Level 3-4 | Karpathy's "Zero to Hero" series | sentdex implementation tutorials |
| Level 5-6 | Yannic Kilcher's paper reviews | StatQuest for mathematical foundations |
| Level 7 | Robert Miles on AI safety | Two Minute Papers for research breadth |

<KeyTakeaway>
Video is the best format for building visual intuition about mathematical concepts and architectural patterns. Use it to complement (not replace) hands-on practice. Watch a Karpathy tutorial, then implement what you learned. Watch a paper review, then read the actual paper. Active viewing beats passive consumption.
