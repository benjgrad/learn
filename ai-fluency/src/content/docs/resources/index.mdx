## Your AI Learning Toolkit

Staying current in a field where the landscape shifts every few months requires a curated "inbox strategy." This resource library collects the most valuable learning materials across formats, organized to complement your progression through the AI fluency levels.

### How to Use This Library

Resources are organized by format. Within each category, materials are tagged by the fluency level they best support:

| Level | Label | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-2 | **Beginner** | Building intuition, understanding concepts |
| 3-4 | **Intermediate** | Hands-on implementation, engineering patterns |
| 5-6 | **Advanced** | Architecture, evaluation, production systems |
| 7 | **Research** | Frontier topics, open problems, safety |

### Resource Categories

- **[Books](/resources/books/)** -- Foundational texts and reference works for deep study
- **[Courses](/resources/courses/)** -- Structured learning programs from universities and platforms
- **[Videos](/resources/videos/)** -- YouTube channels and video series for visual learners
- **[Podcasts](/resources/podcasts/)** -- Audio content for learning during commutes and workouts
- **[Newsletters](/resources/newsletters/)** -- Stay current with curated weekly and daily digests

### Building a Learning Habit

The most effective approach to AI learning is consistent, multi-format engagement:

1. **Daily** (10 minutes): Scan one newsletter to stay aware of new developments
2. **Weekly** (1-2 hours): Listen to a podcast episode or watch a video deep-dive
3. **Monthly** (4-6 hours): Work through a chapter of a book or a course module
4. **Quarterly**: Reassess your learning plan against your fluency goals

The best resource is the one you will actually use consistently. Start with the format that fits your schedule and learning style, then expand. Breadth of awareness comes from newsletters and podcasts; depth of understanding comes from books and courses.
