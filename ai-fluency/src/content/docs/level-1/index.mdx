## Welcome to Level 1

You have used ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini at least once. You typed something in, got something back, and thought: "How does it know that?" This level answers that question.

The goal of Level 1 is to shift your mental model from **AI as a magic box** to **AI as an inference engine** -- a system that uses statistical patterns learned during training to predict what text should come next.

### What you will learn

| Module | Topic | Core Idea |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1.1 | AI as an Inference Engine | Training vs. inference -- the model is not "thinking" |
| 1.2 | The Probabilistic Nature of AI | Why the same prompt gives different answers |
| 1.3 | Basic Prompting Patterns | Summarize, draft, brainstorm -- your first toolkit |
| 1.4 | Choosing the Right Model | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, open-source -- when to use what |
| 1.5 | AI Is Not Thinking | Why fluent text is not understanding |
| 1.6 | When Not to Trust AI | Domain-specific risks and verification |
| 1.7 | Checkpoint | Test your recall without AI |

### The 4D competencies at Level 1

At every level of this curriculum, four competencies shape how you work with AI:

- **Delegation** -- Knowing which tasks to hand to AI and which to keep for yourself.
- **Description** -- Communicating your goal clearly enough that the model can help.
- **Discernment** -- Evaluating whether the output is accurate, useful, or nonsense.
- **Diligence** -- Using AI responsibly, with awareness of its limitations.

At Level 1, the emphasis is on **Discernment**: learning to see AI output as a probabilistic prediction rather than an authoritative answer.

<KeyTakeaway>
AI does not "know" things. It predicts the most likely next token based on patterns in its training data. Understanding this single fact changes how you evaluate every output you receive.

<ConnectPrompt prompt="As you work through Level 1, pay attention to how your perception of AI shifts. Notice when you start catching yourself thinking 'the AI knows this' versus 'the AI is predicting this.'" />
