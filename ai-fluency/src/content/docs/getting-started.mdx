## Welcome to AI Fluency

This platform is designed to take you from wherever you are today to genuine fluency with artificial intelligence. Whether you are a complete beginner or an experienced engineer looking to deepen your understanding, you will find a structured path forward.

## The Learning Cycle

Every module on this platform follows a consistent, evidence-based structure built on learning science research. Understanding this structure will help you get the most from each lesson.

<Steps>
1. **Predict** — Each module opens with a prediction prompt. Before you read the content, you will be asked what you think will happen or what you already know. This activates prior knowledge and primes your brain for new information.

2. **Learn** — The core educational content. This is where you encounter new concepts, technical explanations, and worked examples. Read actively and take notes.

3. **Practice** — Hands-on exercises that ask you to apply what you just learned. These include try-it-yourself challenges with revealable solutions and calibration checks to test your understanding.

4. **Reflect** — After practice, you are asked to explain concepts in your own words and consider reflection questions. Research shows that self-explanation is one of the most powerful learning strategies available.

5. **Connect** — Each module ends by linking what you learned to other topics in the curriculum and to real-world applications. Building these connections strengthens long-term retention.

## The 4D Competency Framework

At every level of the fluency journey, you cultivate four core competencies:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Delegation" icon="rocket">
    Strategic task distribution between humans and AI. Knowing *what* to delegate and *when* to retain human oversight.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Description" icon="pencil">
    Effective communication of goals and behaviors to AI systems. Crafting instructions that minimize ambiguity and maximize accuracy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discernment" icon="magnifier">
    Critical evaluation of AI outputs and processes. Assessing accuracy, quality, and potential bias using objective frameworks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Diligence" icon="warning">
    Responsible and ethical application of AI. Maintaining transparency, accountability, and security in AI-assisted workflows.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

These four competencies apply across the three primary modes of AI engagement: **automation** (AI performing specific tasks), **augmentation** (human and AI acting as thinking partners), and **agency** (AI working independently on behalf of the human).

## Choosing Your Path

### If you are new to AI

Start with the **Foundations** modules. These cover the atomic units of intelligence — tokens, context windows, and probabilistic thinking — along with the mathematical foundations that sustain modern AI. Even if math is not your strength, the Foundations modules build intuition through practical examples rather than formal proofs.

**Recommended path:** Foundations → Level 1 → Level 2

### If you already use AI tools regularly

You may want to skim the Foundations and jump to **Level 2: Prompt Engineer** or **Level 3: Context Engineer**, where you will learn structured techniques for getting better results from AI systems.

**Recommended path:** Foundations (skim) → Level 2 → Level 3

### If you are a software engineer

Start with **Level 3: Context Engineer** to learn about RAG pipelines and grounding, then progress to **Level 4: Component Engineer** and **Level 5: System Engineer** for deep architectural patterns.

**Recommended path:** Level 3 → Level 4 → Level 5

### If you are a technical leader

The **Competency Map** will help you understand the full framework. Then explore **Level 5** and **Level 6: Platformizer** for organizational scaling, governance, and MLOps.

**Recommended path:** Competency Map → Level 5 → Level 6

There is no wrong way to navigate this curriculum. The levels build on each other, but you can always jump ahead and circle back. Use the Competency Map to track your progress across all four dimensions.

## Tips for Effective Learning

- **Do not skip the prediction prompts.** Even if you feel you know nothing about a topic, forming a guess before reading activates your brain's pattern-matching systems.
- **Try the exercises before revealing solutions.** Struggling with a problem — even briefly — makes the solution stick far better than passive reading.
- **Explain back in your own words.** If you cannot explain a concept simply, you do not yet understand it. Use the Explain Back sections as honest self-assessments.
- **Space your learning.** Research consistently shows that distributed practice (learning across multiple sessions) outperforms massed practice (cramming). Aim for 2-3 modules per session with breaks in between.
- **Connect to your own work.** The Connect prompts at the end of each module ask you to relate concepts to your professional context. These connections are what transform abstract knowledge into practical fluency.
