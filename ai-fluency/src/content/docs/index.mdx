## What is AI Fluency?

AI fluency is the conscious ability to collaborate with computational systems in ways that are **effective, efficient, ethical, and safe**. It goes far beyond basic awareness of AI tools — it means developing the technical depth and strategic conviction to think, lead, and operate differently because AI exists.

This curriculum follows a seven-level framework, progressing from casual consumption of AI tools to pioneering fundamental research. At every level, you will build four core competencies: **Delegation**, **Description**, **Discernment**, and **Diligence**.

## The Seven Levels

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Level 0: Foundations" icon="open-book">
    Master the atomic units of intelligence: tokens, context windows, probabilistic thinking, and the mathematical pillars that sustain AI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 1: Casual Consumer" icon="laptop">
    Develop intuition for AI capabilities through direct interaction. Understand inference vs. training, the probabilistic nature of outputs, and basic prompting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 2: Prompt Engineer" icon="pencil">
    Move from casual conversation to precise instructional design. Master zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting, and parameter control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 3: Context Engineer" icon="puzzle">
    Go beyond the model's internal weights to include external data. Build RAG pipelines, work with vector databases, and ground AI in your domain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 4: Component Engineer" icon="setting">
    Treat AI as a modular component within broader software architecture. Apply engineering patterns, deterministic wrappers, and CI/CD for models.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 5: System Engineer" icon="rocket">
    Orchestrate complex multi-stage agentic workflows. Deep-dive into transformer architecture, fine-tuning, and evaluation metrics.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Levels 6-7: Platformizer & Pioneer" icon="star">
    Scale AI across organizations with MLOps and governance. Push boundaries through alignment research, emergent behavior analysis, and ethics.
  </Card>

## How This Platform Works

Every module on this platform uses an **evidence-based learning cycle**:

1. **Predict** — Activate prior knowledge before encountering new material
2. **Learn** — Engage with substantive technical content
3. **Practice** — Apply concepts through hands-on exercises
4. **Reflect** — Consolidate understanding through self-explanation
5. **Connect** — Link new knowledge to other concepts and real-world applications

This structure is grounded in learning science research on retrieval practice, elaborative interrogation, and spaced repetition.
